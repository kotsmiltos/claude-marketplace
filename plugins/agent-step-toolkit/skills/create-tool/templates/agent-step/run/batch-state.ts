// FILE: src/agent-step/run/batch-state.ts
//
// The batch's two state accumulators and the ONLY write path into them.
//
// `view` is the in-batch threaded snapshot: each applied patch folds into it so
// the next step sees fresh state. `committed` accumulates the same patches and
// becomes the LangGraph `Command.update` returned to the graph. Splitting them
// means earlier successful updates land even when a later step in the batch
// fails (cumulative commit on partial failure).
//
// Every state transition in the run pipeline goes through `apply(patch)` —
// admission, gates, controls, executor results, lifecycle. The patch builders
// below are the full vocabulary of library-slot writes; nothing else in the
// pipeline constructs a library-slot patch by hand. (The one deliberate
// exception is the finalize phase's error-counter bookkeeping, which writes
// `committed` directly — see run/finalize.ts for why.)
