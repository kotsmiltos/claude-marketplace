//
// A CONTROL is a library-owned, model-facing action that performs a pure
// orchestration transition — no domain executor, no backend I/O. Controls are
// first-class participants: one `ControlAction` implementation carries
// everything the engine needs, so adding a control never requires editing the
// compile or run phases:
//
//   - activation      — when the control is injected (schema + description +
//                       reserved-name validation), from `activeWhen`;
//   - model surface   — its schema variant and its line in the composed tool
//                       description;
//   - admission       — whether it may lead a locked batch
//                       (`allowedDuringGateLockdown`,
//                       `allowedDuringChoicePending`), how it escapes the
//                       resolved-choice same-turn lock (`sameTurnEscape`),
//                       and its batch-exclusivity group (`exclusivityGroup`);
//   - execution       — `execute()`, which applies its state transition
//                       through the batch-state patch vocabulary and returns
//                       the LLM-facing result entry.
//
// The registry (controls/registry.ts) fixes the injection ORDER — part of the
// model-facing surface, do not reorder.
