// → repeat question → bounded-choice request → bounded-choice resolve).
// Do not reorder without re-verifying the model-facing golden.
//
// Exclusivity groups are likewise evaluated in their declared order at
// admission: a batch mixing a handoff with a choice control is attributed to
// the handoff group.
