// The ENGINE-COMPOSED protocol prompt fragment (owner directive 2026-08-15):
// the system-prompt text that interprets the engine's own machinery —
// tool-turn/speaking-turn, the reply/ask contracts, the gate handshake,
// READ-BACK authority, handoff silence — composed here from
// the host's feature surface, exactly as the tool description already is.
// Hosts splice it into their system prompt via a placeholder and write NONE
// of it themselves: every agent hand-rolling its own rendition of the
// machinery was the family-scale fork this fragment deletes.
//
// Sentence ownership is exclusive (one authority): the tool DESCRIPTION keeps
// its per-action/control one-liners, RESULT BODIES keep the per-turn
// contracts/directives/asks, and THIS fragment keeps the turn/speech
// protocol. The wording is the reference host's measured machinery text,
// generalized only where it named host concepts — changing it upstream
// changes every agent at once, so it is pinned in each host's model-surface
// golden and a diff there demands live re-measurement.
