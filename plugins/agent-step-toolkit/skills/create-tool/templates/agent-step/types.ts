/** A typed library-state transition an executor may request. Effects are

 *
 *  - `request_handoff` — terminal business outcome: atomically clears every
 *    transient runner slot (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`,
 *    `pagedRead`) and writes the `handoff` slot, exactly like the built-in
 *    `request_handoff` action. Honoured regardless of `ok` — a refusal verdict
 *    (e.g. "already closed") may still be terminal. TERMINAL IS ENFORCED:
 *    once the handoff is set, the step's remaining interaction lifecycle
 *    (flow open, OTP/match gates) is skipped and the batch ends after the
 *    current step — later steps do not run (handoff monotonicity, see
 *    run/execution.ts). This is the ONLY way an executor requests a handoff;
 *    writing the `handoff` slot through `stateUpdate` is rejected loudly.
 *  - `merge_flow_data` — shallow-merge into `currentFlow.data`. Honoured on
 *    `ok: true`; requesting it with no active flow (and no `startsFlow` on the
 *    action) is a programmer mistake and throws.
 *  - `otp_issued` — this step minted an SCA challenge; the runner opens the
 *    OTP gate for the consumer named in the action's `issuesOtp` hook.
 *    Honoured on `ok: true`; requires an active flow and the config hook.
 *  - `clear_awaiting_input` — drop the pending input gate only, keep the flow.
 *    Used for "the current OTP is dead but the flow continues" (e.g. timeout).
 *    Honoured regardless of `ok`.
 *  - `abort_flow` — terminal in-flow failure; drop the gate AND the flow (and
 *    any bounded-choice overlay). Honoured regardless of `ok`. */
