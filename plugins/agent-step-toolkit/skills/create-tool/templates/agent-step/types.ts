/** Result a single executor returns to the runner. `resultBody` is the
 *  JSON-serializable object the LLM sees as that step's payload. `stateUpdate`
 *  is a partial patch the runner threads to subsequent steps in the batch AND
 *  accumulates into the final tool Command. `ok` is a batch-continuation
 *  control flag, NOT a success/verdict signal: `ok: true` proceeds to the next
 *  step; `ok: false` short-circuits the batch and sets `failed_at`. An executor
 *  may return `ok: true` for a "negative" domain outcome (carry the verdict in

 *  by flow-bound executors to update their own scratch state. Writing

 *  `startsFlow`) is a programmer mistake and the runner errors loudly.
 *
 *  `lifecycle` is a typed union of library-managed state transitions:
 *  - `issuesOtp` — this step minted an SCA challenge; runner sets
 *    `awaitingInput.kind="otp"` for the configured consumer action.
 *  - `clearAwaitingInput` — drop `awaitingInput` only, keep `currentFlow`.
 *    Used for "current OTP is dead but the flow continues" (e.g. timeout).
 *  - `abortFlow` — terminal failure; drop `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow`.
