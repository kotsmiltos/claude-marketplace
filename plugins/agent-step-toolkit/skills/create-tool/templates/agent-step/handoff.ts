/**
 * agent-step handoff
 *
 * Library-coordinated conversation handoff. Two cooperating halves:
 *
 * 1. The runner auto-injects a built-in `request_handoff` action into the tool
 *    schema when `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff` is provided. The action is
 *    the LLM's actuator — detection lives in the host's prompt. Its "executor"
 *    (runner-internal, see runner.ts) atomically abandons transient runner
 *    state and patches the library-managed `handoff` slot; it performs no I/O,
 *    so the runner stays pure.
 *
 * 2. `createHandoffNode` builds the graph node that RESOLVES the slot. The host
 *    graph wires a conditional edge after its tool node (`handoffRequested`)
 *    into this node, which:
 *      - emits a `handoff` custom event via `config.writer` (streamMode
 *        "custom") BEFORE any response content, so streaming clients can react
 *        (abort TTS, switch routing) without parsing message text;
 *      - terminate mode: uses the fixed `terminateMessage` envelope;
 *      - delegate mode (off_topic): calls the delegate LangGraph deployment
 *        with the SAME thread id, forwards its LLM tokens through the writer
 *        as `delegated_token` custom events, and uses its final text;
 *        any delegate failure falls back to the terminate envelope
 *        (behavioral fallback — not a config fallback);
 *      - emits a `handoff_complete` custom event carrying the final text
 *        (node-constructed AIMessages never appear in the `messages` token
 *        stream, so streaming clients need this to render/speak the reply);
 *      - returns `{ handoff: null, messages: [AIMessage] }` — the final
 *        AIMessage carries the channel-contract `additional_kwargs`:
 *        terminate (and delegate-failure fallback) is the off_topic HANDBACK
 *        (`is_handoff: true`, `handoff_type: "off_topic"`, `handoff_reason` =
 *        the customer's request, `handoff_metadata: { service_type,
 *        success_message }` — the middleware re-routes the turn to the
 *        orchestrator); delegate success is NOT a handoff (the conversation
 *        stays with this agent; only an informational `delegated_to` rides
 *        along). The model never sees the result: the host graph routes this
 *        node straight to END, so there is no paraphrase pass.
 *
 * The delegate client is a minimal fetch/SSE implementation of the LangGraph
 * Platform API (`POST /threads`, `POST /threads/{id}/runs/stream` with
 * `stream_mode: ["messages-tuple"]`) — no SDK dependency. The shared thread id
 * is safe by construction: the delegate is a separate deployment with its own
 * checkpointer (one graph per deployment), so the id is pure correlation.
