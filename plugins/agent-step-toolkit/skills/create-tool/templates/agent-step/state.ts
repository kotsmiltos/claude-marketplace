/** Schema for the library-managed `awaitingInput` slot. This is the single
 *  source of truth: the `AwaitingInput` TS type is inferred from it, and the
 *  LangGraph annotation + Zod shape consumers spread in (`agentStepStateSpec`,
 *  `agentStepZodShape`) are built from it. Hosts must NOT re-declare this —
 *  spread the exported fragments so the slot the runner mutates can never
 *  drift from the storage the host provides.
 *
 *  Discriminated union over the four kinds of input the controller
 *  coordinates:
 *
 *  - `confirmation`: a confirm-required mutation has been proposed; the same
 *    action with matching params re-fired will execute. The library counts
 *    attempts on re-propose-with-drifted-params and exhausts the slot when the
 *    counter hits zero. Semantically: "customer must say YES."
 *  - `otp`: an action has issued an SCA challenge; the named consumer action
 *    is the only thing that may run next (besides `abort_pending_input`). The
 *    library NEVER counts OTP attempts — the backend is authoritative for
 *    lock/timeout/wrong-code. Semantically: "customer must provide OTP digits."
 *  - `match`: a capturer stored a value (PIN, password, …); the consumer must
 *    receive the same value to verify match. The library decrements
 *    `attempts_left` on each `match_mismatch` and aborts the flow on
 *    exhaustion. Semantically: "customer must provide the value AGAIN."
 *  - `dictation`: a step's verdict asked the customer for a fresh value (the
 *    plainest input kind — declared per verdict via `ActionDef.asks`, applied
 *    by the batch finalizer from the batch's FINAL entry, and made visible to
 *    the model on that entry as `standing_ask` + `ask_contract`). Unlike the
 *    three gates it does NOT lock the surface: it is the record of the
 *    standing question — capturing the answer remains the MODEL's job.
 *    Semantically: "customer owes the value the first time."
 *
 *  `flow_ref` ties the input to its owning flow; clearing the owning
 *  `currentFlow` clears `awaitingInput` too. No timestamps / `expires_at` —
 *  the library is a lockdown mechanism, not a state-decay manager. Stale state
 *  is cleared via `abort_pending_input` or a backend-reported error. */
