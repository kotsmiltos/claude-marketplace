// FILE: src/agent-step/handoff/node.ts
//
// The graph node that RESOLVES a pending `handoff` slot. The host wires a
// conditional edge after its tool node (`handoffRequested`) into this node,
// with a direct edge to END — the model must never see (and paraphrase) the
// result. The node:
//
//   - emits a `handoff` custom event via `config.writer` (streamMode "custom")
//     BEFORE any response content, so streaming clients can react (abort TTS,
//     switch routing) without parsing message text;
//   - terminate mode: uses the fixed `terminateMessage` envelope;
//   - delegate mode (off_topic): calls the delegate LangGraph deployment with
//     the SAME thread id (handoff/delegate-client.ts), forwards its LLM tokens
//     through the writer as `delegated_token` custom events, and uses its
//     final text; any delegate failure falls back to the terminate envelope
//     (behavioral fallback — not a config fallback);
//   - emits a `handoff_complete` custom event carrying the final text
//     (node-constructed AIMessages never appear in the `messages` token
//     stream, so streaming clients need this to render/speak the reply);
//   - clears task-scoped state on a task-ENDING handback (`completed` /
//     `abandon`): the library's own `agentStepTaskScopedSlots` plus the host's
//     `HandoffSpec.clearsOnHandback` domain slots, because the thread outlives
//     the task (middlewares reuse one thread id per call). `off_topic` and a
//     successful delegate clear nothing — both stay resumable;
//   - returns `{ handoff: null, ...clears, messages: [AIMessage] }` — the final AIMessage
//     carries the channel-contract `additional_kwargs`: terminate (and
//     delegate-failure fallback) is the HANDBACK (`is_handoff: true`,
//     `handoff_type`, `handoff_reason` = the request's context,
//     `handoff_metadata: { service_type, success_message }` — the middleware
//     routes on it); delegate success is NOT a handoff (the conversation stays
//     with this agent; only an informational `delegated_to` rides along).
//
// THIS FILE IS PART OF THE FROZEN CHANNEL CONTRACT — the custom-event shapes
// and the final-message `additional_kwargs` envelope are read by the voice
// middleware. Do not reshape them without coordinating the middleware repos.
