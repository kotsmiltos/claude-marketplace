// The handoff CONTRACT: the built-in action's name/schema/description, the
// handback signal vocabulary, the host-facing `HandoffSpec`, and the graph
// edge predicate. Two cooperating halves consume it:
//
//   1. The runner auto-injects the built-in `request_handoff` action into the
//      tool schema when `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff` is provided
//      (controls/request-handoff.ts). The action is the LLM's actuator —
//      detection lives in the host's prompt. It atomically abandons transient
//      runner state and patches the library-managed `handoff` slot; it
//      performs no I/O, so the runner stays pure.
//
//   2. `createHandoffNode` (handoff/node.ts) builds the graph node that
//      RESOLVES the slot — event emission and terminate/delegate I/O live
//      there, wired after the tool node behind the `handoffRequested` edge
//      predicate.
