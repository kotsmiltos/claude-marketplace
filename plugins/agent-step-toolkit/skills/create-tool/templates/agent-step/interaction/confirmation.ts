// FILE: src/agent-step/interaction/confirmation.ts

// The confirmation gate: a confirm-required mutation runs as a two-call
// handshake. The FIRST matching call proposes (stores params, returns
// `needs_confirmation`, does NOT execute); a later call with the SAME params
// executes; a call with DIFFERENT params re-proposes and spends one attempt.
//
// SAFETY PROPERTY — same-batch bypass. Confirm modes are assigned during plan
// expansion against the state AT BATCH START and frozen before any step runs
// (run/planning.ts). A propose written by step N therefore cannot satisfy an
// execute requested at step N+1 of the same batch: both resolve to `propose`.
// The confirming call must arrive in a NEW tool call — i.e. after the caller
// actually answered. Nothing in the execution loop re-reads pending state to
// re-derive a mode.

 *  - `sameTurnLocked`: pending exists with matching params, but the proposal
 *    was stored on the CURRENT caller turn — the caller has not yet answered
 *    the read-back, so executing would be the model confirming itself.
 *    Refused without spending an attempt; the gate stays untouched. Enforced
 *    only when BOTH the stored and the current turn identity exist (production
 *    always has message ids; identity-less direct consumers keep the
 *    params-only behavior rather than being locked out of confirmation).
 *  - `exhausted`: pending exists with `attemptsLeft <= 0` → clear pending,
 *    return error. Customer must restart the operation.
 *
 *  Actions without `requiresConfirmation` skip this machine entirely — they
