//
// The OTP gate: an `issuesOtp` action mints an SCA challenge (reported via the
// `otp_issued` effect); the named consumer action is then the only thing that
// may run until the gate clears. Policy summary:
//
//   - Lockdown: ALWAYS on while pending — no opt-out (unlike confirmation).
//   - Attempts: the library NEVER counts OTP attempts. The backend is
//     authoritative for lock/timeout/wrong-code; the executor surfaces those
//     as `clear_awaiting_input` (gate dead, flow continues) or `abort_flow`
//     (terminal) effects.
//   - Freshness: the consumer check reads the LIVE in-batch view, so the
//     legitimate same-batch `[consumer, issuer]` chain works (the consumer
//     clears the match gate, then the issuer opens the OTP gate). Contrast
//     with the match gate, which freezes at batch start (interaction/match.ts).
//   - Ordering invariant: at most one input gate at a time, match THEN otp —
//     see `refuseOtpIssueWhileMatchPending`.

 *  THEN otp": the match consumer must clear the match before any OTP is
 *  issued. Without this, a single batch like `[capturer, issuer]` would
 *  open+send the OTP and OVERWRITE the still-pending match gate, skipping the
 *  consumer (the second entry) entirely. Uses the LIVE view (not batch-start)
 *  so the legitimate `[consumer, issuer]` batch still works — the consumer
 *  clears the match earlier in the same batch, so by the time the issuer runs
 *  no match is pending. Checked PRE-execution so the executor's side effect
 *  (e.g. sending a code) never fires on refusal. */
