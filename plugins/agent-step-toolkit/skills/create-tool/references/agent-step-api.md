# Reference: agent-step Library API

<overview>
This is the runner contract the new tool consumes. The library lives at `src/agent-step/` and is **treated as immutable**: never modify it; only call `buildAgentStepTool({...})` with the right shape. The summary below is the canonical contract — match it exactly. The ground truth is in `src/agent-step/types.ts` (authoring contracts) + `src/agent-step/index.ts` (the public surface); if this doc disagrees with those, the source wins.

Since 2.0.0 the library is laid out as phase modules — `compile/` (validate → normalize → model-facing schema), `run/` (admission → planning → execution → finalize), `interaction/` (one policy module per gate kind), `controls/` (the library-owned model-facing actions), `handoff/` (contract + graph node + delegate transport). **Hosts import ONLY from `src/agent-step/index.js`** — the module layout is internal and free to move; everything a tool consumes is re-exported at the index.
</overview>

<runner_signature>
```ts
import { buildAgentStepTool } from "../../agent-step/index.js";

export const myTool = buildAgentStepTool({
  config: myConfig,                // AgentStepConfig<ActionName, PrereqName>
  stateSchema: AgentStateSchema,   // StateSchemaLike — the host's graph state schema
  selectors,                       // SelectorRegistry<T, ActionName> — one per action
  executors,                       // ExecutorRegistry<T, typeof selectors>
  verifiers,                       // VerifierRegistry<T>
  handoff: handoffSpec,            // OPTIONAL — opt into the built-in request_handoff (see <handoff>)
  boundedChoices: { ... },         // OPTIONAL — opt into the one-shot bounded-choice overlay (see <bounded_choice>)
  getCallerTurnId: (state) => id,  // OPTIONAL — stable caller-turn identity resolver (see <caller_turn_identity>)
  messages: { ... },               // OPTIONAL — override the runner's own system summary strings (see <system_messages>)
});
```

`stateSchema` is **required**: `StateSchemaLike = LangGraphAnnotationLike | z.ZodObject` — it accepts **either** a LangGraph `Annotation.Root` **or** a Zod object schema whose fields carry reducer/default metadata via `withLangGraph` (`@langchain/langgraph/zod`). Both resolve to the same channel classes (`BinaryOperatorAggregate` / `LastValue`), so the runner derives the intra-batch merger uniformly. The bootstrap scaffold defines graph state **once** as a Zod schema (`AgentStateSchema` in `state.ts`) and passes it here — a single source of truth for reducers AND invoke validation, no Annotation/Zod drift. (The pre-2.0 `stateAnnotation` alias was **removed** in 2.0.0 — pass `stateSchema`, which accepts the same values.)

`selectors` and `executors` are both **keyed 1:1 by the exact action name** (snake_case). Build `selectors` with `satisfies SelectorRegistry<State, ActionName>` (not a type annotation) so each selector's precise return type is preserved into `typeof selectors`; `executors` is then `ExecutorRegistry<State, typeof selectors>`, which types each executor's `state` param from its selector's return — a mismatch is a compile error here, at the construction boundary. See `<conventions>` §1.

Returns a LangChain `StructuredTool` ready to register in `src/tools/index.ts`.
</runner_signature>

<types>
## AgentStepConfig

```ts
interface AgentStepConfig<ActionName extends string, PrereqName extends string> {
  tool: { name: string; description: string };
  actions: Record<ActionName, ActionDef<PrereqName>>;
}
```

`tool.name` becomes the LangChain tool name surfaced to the LLM (e.g. `"card_agent_step"`, `"accounts_agent_step"`).

`tool.description` is the lead paragraph; the library appends a per-action bullet list automatically.

There is **no top-level `mutations` map**. All per-action behavioural opts (confirmation / OTP / match / flow lifecycle, batch-shape flags) live inline on each action under `ActionDef.controller`. Downstream-slot invalidation lives inline under `ActionDef.invalidatesOnChange`.

## ActionDef

```ts
interface ActionDef<PrereqName extends string> {
  description: string;             // non-empty; flows into Zod .describe() AND tool description
  summary?: string;                // optional one-line label for the tool-level action index. Add one
                                   // when the action NAME isn't self-explanatory to the model; the full
                                   // mechanics always live in `description` regardless. Omit it and the
                                   // index just lists the action name alone.
  paramsSchema: z.ZodTypeAny;      // params the LLM must send
  prereqs: PrereqName[];           // state predicates checked before invoking executor
  invalidatesOnChange?: Record<string, string[]>;
                                   // keys are slots this action may write; values are downstream
                                   // slots to reset to null when the watched slot's value CHANGES
                                   // (non-null → different value). First-time set / same-value
                                   // writes do NOT fire. See <invalidates_on_change>.
  pageable?: PageableSpec;         // opt a LIST read into uniform pagination. The runner injects
                                   // page/pageSize params, slices the result, and emits a standard
                                   // envelope. Requires a z.object paramsSchema. See <pagination>.
  controller?: ControllerHooks;    // lifecycle hooks coordinated by the runner (confirmation /
                                   // OTP / match / flow / batch-isolation). Omit for plain reads.
}
```

## ControllerHooks

Per-action behavioural opts coordinated by the library, declared inline as `ActionDef.controller`. Despite the "mutation" framing, it covers gating, lifecycle, and flow hooks for read-ish actions too (`request_*` issuing OTPs, `confirm_*_otp` consuming them).

```ts
interface ControllerHooks {
  // ─── Batch-shape constraints ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  soleStep?: boolean;                       // strict: refuse any batch larger than 1.
  soleOnExecute?: boolean;                  // relaxed: propose may ride as LAST step;
                                            // execute mode must be alone.
                                            // (soleStep wins if both are set.)

  // ─── Confirm-required propose/execute gate ─────────────────────────────────
  requiresConfirmation?: boolean | ConfirmationOpts;

  // ─── SCA / OTP gating ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  requiresOtp?: boolean;                    // refuse unless awaitingInput.kind="otp"
                                            // for this action; auto-clears on ok:true.
  issuesOtp?: { consumer_action: string };  // executor reports the `otp_issued` effect;
                                            // library sets awaitingInput=otp.

  // ─── Multi-turn flow lifecycle ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  startsFlow?: { name: string };            // on ok: create currentFlow (or merge if same name).
  endsFlow?: boolean;                       // on ok: clear currentFlow AND awaitingInput.
  requiresFlow?: string;                    // refuse unless currentFlow.name matches.

  // ─── Double-entry verification (PIN/password repeat) ───────────────────────
  startsMatchFor?: { consumer_action: string };
                                            // capturer: on ok, set awaitingInput=match for consumer.
  requiresMatch?: { capturer: string; maxAttempts?: number };
                                            // consumer: refuse unless awaitingInput=match for this;
                                            // library decrements on verdict:"match_mismatch";
                                            // aborts flow on exhaustion; auto-clears on ok:true.
}

interface ConfirmationOpts {
  maxAttempts?: number;            // re-propose budget before the gate exhausts. Default 3 —
                                   // almost always right. Lower to 1–2 for high-stakes mutations
                                   // where you want to bail fast on param drift.
  lockdown?: boolean;              // default true — refuses unrelated batches while a confirmation is
                                   // pending. Leave it true. Set false only if you deliberately want
                                   // unrelated READS to proceed mid-confirmation (rare; weakens the
                                   // safety gate, since the customer can wander off the pending action).
  readBack?: (params: Record<string, unknown>, state: unknown) => string | undefined;
                                   // OPTIONAL (2.3.0) — render what the runner ACTUALLY recorded, for
                                   // the model to speak back verbatim. A non-empty return rides the
                                   // proposal body as `read_back` beside `proposed_params`. See below.
}
```

**`readBack`** exists because the library owns the CAPTURE half — `capture.ts` sanitized, joined and
validated those params — so it alone knows the exact stored value. Handing the model raw
`proposed_params` and leaving "tell the caller what was recorded" to its discretion is measurably where
read-backs break: a model converting digits to words drops or doubles one on runs of equals, and the
caller then confirms against wrong words — the one mistake a confirmation gate cannot catch. The
library does NOT own the LEXICON (rendering is language- and channel-specific), so the host supplies
this function. It receives the **parsed** params (rendering from what was stored is what stops the
read-back drifting from what executes) and the current state view. Deliberately non-generic —
`ConfirmationOpts` carries no state type, so hosts cast their own state exactly as executors do with
their slices. Pair it with a prompt rule telling the model to speak `read_back` verbatim when present;
without such a rule the field is inert.

There is deliberately **no TTL**: the runner times nothing out. Stale gates clear via `abort_pending_input` or via backend signals the executor surfaces as `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow` effects. (2.0.0 removed the inert `ttlMs` field and the empty `OtpOpts` type — `requiresOtp` is a plain `boolean`; the library never counts OTP attempts, the backend is authoritative.)

The executor owns any pre-read and post-read; the library enforces the gates above plus the propose-then-execute handshake (see `<confirmation_lifecycle>`).

## Verifier

```ts
interface Verifier<T> {
  check: (state: T) => boolean;
  denial: { summary: string; error: string };
}
```

Self-contained: the predicate AND the denial body live together in one file. The denial body is what appears in the result envelope when the prereq fails.

The `check` predicate is a snapshot of **journey progress** — "is the user identified?", "is an entity selected?" — not a record of step ordering. Gate on *where the user is*, never on *what ran first*. The companion mechanism for keeping that progress coherent when an upstream slot changes is `invalidatesOnChange` (see `<invalidates_on_change>` below).

## ExecutorResult + ExecutorEffect

```ts
interface ExecutorResult<T> {
  resultBody: object;              // JSON-serializable; the LLM sees this
  stateUpdate?: Partial<T>;        // HOST-OWNED slots only — threaded to subsequent batch
                                   // steps + committed at end. Writing a library-managed slot
                                   // (awaitingInput, currentFlow, boundedChoice, pagedRead,
                                   // deflectedAside, handoff, errorCount) through it THROWS —
                                   // library transitions go through `effects` instead.
  effects?: ExecutorEffect[];      // typed library-state transitions (below)
  ok: boolean;                     // false short-circuits the batch
}

type ExecutorEffect =
  | { type: "request_handoff"; request: HandoffRequest }
                                   // terminal business outcome: atomically clears every transient
                                   // runner slot (awaitingInput, currentFlow, boundedChoice,
                                   // pagedRead) and writes the `handoff` slot — exactly like the
                                   // built-in request_handoff action. Honoured regardless of `ok`
                                   // (a refusal verdict may still be terminal). TERMINAL IS
                                   // ENFORCED: once the handoff is set, the step's remaining
                                   // interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch ends after
                                   // the current step (handoff monotonicity). The ONLY way an
                                   // executor requests a handoff.
  | { type: "merge_flow_data"; data: Record<string, unknown> }
                                   // shallow-merge into currentFlow.data. Honoured on ok:true;
                                   // requesting it with no active flow (and no startsFlow on the
                                   // action) is a programmer mistake and throws.
  | { type: "otp_issued" }         // this step minted an SCA challenge; the runner opens the OTP
                                   // gate for the consumer named in the action's issuesOtp hook.
                                   // Honoured on ok:true; requires an active flow + the config
                                   // hook. Keep challenge details (challengeId etc.) in
                                   // resultBody and/or a merge_flow_data effect — the runner
                                   // never read them.
  | { type: "clear_awaiting_input" }
                                   // drop the pending input gate only, keep the flow. Use for
                                   // "the current OTP is dead but the flow continues" (timeout).
                                   // Honoured regardless of `ok`.
  | { type: "abort_flow" };        // terminal in-flow failure; drop the gate AND the flow (and
                                   // any bounded-choice overlay). Honoured regardless of `ok`.
```

Effects are **signals, not an ordered program** — the runner honours each one at a fixed, documented point of the step lifecycle (see `<state_threading>` step 5f). Pre-2.0 executors expressed these as `flowData` and a `lifecycle` object; both are gone.

## Selector / SelectorRegistry

```ts
// Projects the host state T down to the slice ONE action's executor needs.
// Trusted glue: may reshape/rename, not just narrow. Looked up by action name.
type Selector<T> = (state: T) => unknown;

// Selectors keyed 1:1 by action name (the key IS the action name).
type SelectorRegistry<T, ActionName extends string> = Record<ActionName, Selector<T>>;
```

The runner runs `selectors[action](view)` and hands the result to the executor as its `state`. The executor never sees the whole state — only what its selector returned. Keep selectors pure (no I/O).

## Executor / ExecutorRegistry

```ts
// Receives `Slice` — whatever the action's selector returned — NOT the whole
// state. Returns an ExecutorResult<T> whose stateUpdate may patch any
// HOST-OWNED slot (the reducers merge them); library-managed slots are
// rejected loudly — request those transitions via `effects`.
type Executor<Slice, T> = (params: unknown, state: Slice) => Promise<ExecutorResult<T>>;

// Keyed 1:1 by action name. Each entry's `state` param is derived from that
// action's selector return (ReturnType<Selectors[K]>), so an executor whose
// signature doesn't match what its selector produces is a compile error.
type ExecutorRegistry<T, Selectors extends Record<string, Selector<T>>> = {
  [K in keyof Selectors]: Executor<ReturnType<Selectors[K]>, T>;
};
```

## AwaitingInput (library-managed)

The runner's lockdown slot. Discriminated union over the three input gates:

```ts
type AwaitingInput =
  | { kind: "confirmation"; for_action: string; params: object;
      attempts_left: number; max_attempts: number; flow_ref?: string;
      proposed_on_caller_turn_id?: string }   // the caller turn the proposal was stored on;
                                              // a matching re-call on the SAME turn is refused
                                              // (confirmation_same_turn_locked) — see
                                              // <confirmation_lifecycle>. Absent when no stable
                                              // turn identity existed at propose time.
  | { kind: "otp";          for_action: string; flow_ref: string }
  | { kind: "match";        for_action: string;
      attempts_left: number; max_attempts: number; flow_ref?: string };
```

Lockdown semantics (first step of the next batch must satisfy this):

| kind | allowed first step | else |
|------|-------------------|------|
| `confirmation` | `for_action` (resolves to execute/re-propose/exhausted) or `abort_pending_input` | `pending_confirmation_locked` |
| `otp` | `for_action` or `abort_pending_input` | `otp_pending_locked` |
| `match` | `for_action`, the **capturer** (re-capture resets), or `abort_pending_input` | `match_pending_locked` |

The library does NOT TTL any slot. Stale gates clear via `abort_pending_input` or via backend signals (timeout/lockout, surfaced by the executor as `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow` effects).

## CurrentFlow (library-managed)

Single active flow at a time (flow mutex). Set on `startsFlow` ok; cleared on `endsFlow` ok or an `abort_flow` effect:

```ts
interface CurrentFlow {
  name: string;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;   // scratch bag; executors merge via the merge_flow_data effect
}
```

Starting a different flow while another is active fails with `error: "flow_already_active"`. Re-entering the SAME flow is idempotent — the executor runs (e.g. to re-issue an OTP), and its `merge_flow_data` effect shallow-merges into the existing `currentFlow.data` (no reset).

## BoundedChoice (library-managed)

The one-shot conversational-choice overlay's slot (see `<bounded_choice>`). `null` until a configured choice is offered; the runner is the only writer. Unlike `awaitingInput`, this does NOT replace or unlock a pending confirmation/OTP/match gate — a caller-facing meta-choice may temporarily suspend the spoken question while the original gate remains authoritative underneath.

```ts
interface BoundedChoice {
  name: string;                        // which configured choice
  status: "pending" | "resolved";      // pending = the caller still owes a selection
  selection?: string;                  // the recorded nonterminal selection
  requested_on_caller_turn_id?: string;// turn the choice was OFFERED on — while current,
                                       // it cannot be resolved/consumed (same-turn lock)
  resolved_on_caller_turn_id?: string; // turn a nonterminal selection resolved on — domain
                                       // actions stay locked while that turn is current
}
```

`resolved` deliberately persists until the surrounding flow ends or a terminal handoff clears it, so the same one-shot choice cannot be offered again later in the conversation.

## PagedCache (library-managed)

The reslice-cache for `pageable` reads (self mode). On a cache miss the runner stores the full result set + the query signature; on a same-query re-page it serves the page from here WITHOUT re-running the executor. One active set at a time; untouched unless an action declares `pageable`.

```ts
interface PagedCache<Row> {
  key: string;                       // the action name that produced the set
  signature: string;                 // params signature (excludes page/pageSize)
  rows: Row[];                       // the FULL set
  extras: Record<string, unknown>;   // the executor's non-`items` result fields, replayed per page
}
```

The host gets the `pagedRead: PagedCache<unknown> | null` slot (alongside `awaitingInput` / `currentFlow` / `boundedChoice` / `deflectedAside` / `handoff` / `errorCount` / `guardTurn`) by spreading the library's `agentStepZodShape` into its Zod state schema — the bootstrap state template does this. Each slot in `agentStepZodShape` is wrapped with `withLangGraph` so it carries the runner's expected last-writer-wins reducer/default as channel metadata. The per-slot schemas (`AwaitingInputSchema`, `CurrentFlowSchema`, `BoundedChoiceSchema`, `PagedCacheSchema`, `HandoffRequestSchema`) are individually exported from `index.ts` too. (A host still on a LangGraph `Annotation.Root` spreads the equivalent `agentStepStateSpec` fragment instead — still exported, but the scaffold uses the Zod path.) Since 2.0.0 `buildAgentStepTool` **verifies channel completeness at construction**: a state schema missing a channel for any library slot the configuration writes throws (the message names the missing slots and the spreadable fragments).

`index.ts` also exports **`agentStepTaskScopedSlots`** (2.2.0) — the subset of library slots that describe work IN PROGRESS (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `boundedChoice`, `pagedRead`, `deflectedAside` (2.4.0), `errorCount`), which `createHandoffNode` nulls when a task-ENDING handback resolves. `handoff` is deliberately absent: the node returns it as null either way. (`deflectedAside` being task-scoped means a task-ENDING handback re-arms the free deflection for the next task, while an `off_topic` re-route — not a task ending — deliberately does NOT.) See `<handoff>` for the clearing rules and the host-slot counterpart (`HandoffSpec.clearsOnHandback`).

`index.ts` also exports **`agentStepInternalSlotMask`** — a Zod `.omit()` mask of the eight library-managed slot keys. A host derives a graph INPUT schema by omitting these (they are runner-written only, never caller input) from its full state schema: `AgentStateSchema.omit({ ...agentStepInternalSlotMask, /* + any host-derived slots */ }).partial().extend({ messages: MessagesZodState.shape.messages })`. Re-attach `messages` after `.partial()` — `.partial()` strips the messages-channel metadata LangGraph Studio keys off to render its chat input box (see `state-and-prompt-integration.md`). Wired as the `input` of a hand-built `new StateGraph({ state, input })`, this rejects/coerces a malformed or internal-slot-injecting invoke at the boundary.

## HandoffRequest (library-managed)

The pending channel-handoff request, written by the built-in `request_handoff` action (only available when the tool opted in via `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff`) or by an executor's `request_handoff` **effect** — never through `stateUpdate` — and resolved — then cleared — by the host graph's `createHandoffNode(spec)` node. `null` otherwise; rides `agentStepZodShape` like the other slots. Once set, handoff is **monotonic**: the step's remaining interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch ends after the current step. See `<handoff>`.

```ts
interface HandoffRequest {
  reason: "off_topic" | "completed" | "abandon";
  context: string;  // per-reason, never empty, always in the customer's language:
                    // off_topic → the customer's request (verbatim or tightly summarized);
                    // completed / abandon → the LLM-composed closing line the node speaks
}

## guardTurn (library-managed, HOST-written) — 2.3.0

The turn-scoped latch for **host model-input guards**: `Record<string, string> | null`, mapping a guard id to the caller-turn id it last fired on. It exists because the ReAct loop re-enters the model several times within ONE caller turn (agent → tools → agent …), so a host guard whose condition stays true would re-inject its note on every pass. Deciding "has this already fired since the caller last spoke?" needs the stable caller-turn identity the library already owns (`<caller_turn_identity>`) — hosts that re-derived it by scanning messages backwards ended up parking the answer in the resolved message's `additional_kwargs`, i.e. inside the frozen channel contract.

```ts
guardFiredOnTurn(state, guardId, getCallerTurnId?): boolean   // has it fired on the CURRENT turn?
markGuardFired(state, guardId, getCallerTurnId?): Partial<T>  // patch recording that it just did
```

- **The runner never writes this slot** — it is the one library slot excluded from the executor `stateUpdate` guard (`LIBRARY_MANAGED_KEYS`), because banning a slot the runner doesn't coordinate would ban nothing. It is also absent from `agentStepTaskScopedSlots`: entries expire by themselves when the turn id changes, so the latch is turn-scoped, not task-scoped.
- **No turn identity ⇒ UNLATCHED** (returns false, patch is empty) — an identity-less consumer keeps the unlatched behaviour rather than being silently locked out, the same stance the confirmation gate takes for `sameTurnLocked`.
- **The patches do NOT compose by spreading.** Each carries a whole `guardTurn` map built from the state passed in, and the reducer replaces — so `{...markGuardFired(s,"a"), ...markGuardFired(s,"b")}` loses `"a"`. Chain them instead (feed the first patch's state forward, or merge the maps by hand). Pinned by a library test.
- The library owns the LATCH and the turn identity only. What a guard says, and where the host injects it, stay the host's prompt.

## errorCount (library-managed)

The consecutive backend-failure counter for the auto-handoff guard (`<auto_handoff>`). `number | null`; rides `agentStepZodShape` like the other slots. The runner increments it when a batch ends in a backend failure, resets it to 0 when a batch in which an executor **actually ran** ends without one, and clears it to 0 when it auto-triggers a handoff at the threshold. Batches where no executor ran (confirm-gate proposals/re-proposals, prereq or param refusals, aborts, handoff signals) are **neutral** — they neither increment nor reset. Executors must never write it.

</types>

<conventions>
## 1. Selector + executor keyed by the exact action name

Selectors and executors are registered **1:1 under the exact action name** (snake_case). There is NO name transformation — the registry key IS the action name. (Earlier versions derived a camelCase executor key by snake-to-camel; that convention is gone.)

```ts
const selectors = {
  verify_customer: verifyCustomerSlice,   // getSlice from actions/verify_customer/stateSelector.ts
  list_accounts:   listAccountsSlice,
} satisfies SelectorRegistry<State, ActionName>;

const executors: ExecutorRegistry<State, typeof selectors> = {
  verify_customer: verifyCustomer,        // the function name is free; the KEY is the action name
  list_accounts:   listAccounts,
};
```

The executor function name itself is unconstrained (camelCase is conventional, e.g. `verifyCustomer`), but the **registry key** must be the action name. The runner throws at construction if either registry is missing an action's entry:

```
agent-step: action "verify_customer" expects a state selector at selectors["verify_customer"] but none was found.
agent-step: action "verify_customer" expects an executor at executors["verify_customer"] but none was found.
```

## 2. Verifier name = prereq name

A prereq name in `ActionDef.prereqs` (e.g. `"customerVerified"`) is the same key used in the `verifiers` registry. Runner throws:

```
agent-step: action "verify_card" lists prereq "customerVerified" but verifiers["customerVerified"] was not provided.
```

## 3. Reserved action names

`abort_pending_input` is ALWAYS reserved — the library auto-injects it into the tool schema whenever ANY action declares one of: `requiresConfirmation`, `requiresOtp`, `issuesOtp`, `startsFlow`, `endsFlow`, `requiresFlow`, `requiresMatch`, `startsMatchFor`. `request_handoff` is reserved ONLY when `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff` is provided (see `<handoff>`) — a tool that does NOT opt in may define its own action under that name (the orchestrator/scaffold handoff mechanism does exactly that). `request_bounded_choice` / `resolve_bounded_choice` are reserved ONLY when `boundedChoices` is provided (see `<bounded_choice>`). `deflect_aside` (2.4.0) is reserved ONLY when `HandoffSpec.deflectAside` is set (see `<handoff>`). These library-owned actions are **controls** (`controls/` in the library): each carries its own activation, schema variant, description line, lockdown allowances, and execution — the run pipeline dispatches them instead of an executor. Declaring a reserved name throws:

```
agent-step: "<name>" is a reserved action name auto-injected by the library; remove it from config.actions.
```

`abort_pending_input` is idempotent — it clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow` together. No-op when nothing is active.

## 4. Per-action description is required

A non-empty `description` string is required on every action. Empty/missing throws:

```
agent-step: action "fetch_balance" is missing a non-empty description.
```

## 5. Controller hooks live on the action

Lifecycle opts are declared inline as `ActionDef.controller`, so there is no separate map that can drift from `actions`. A controller-referenced peer action (e.g. an `issuesOtp.consumer_action` or a `requiresMatch.capturer`) must still name a real action, or the corresponding runtime check throws (see `<construction_time_checks>`).
</conventions>

<state_threading>
## How state flows through a batch

When the LLM calls the tool with `[step1, step2, step3]`:

1. Runner reads the FULL state via `getCurrentTaskInput<T>()` — this is the snapshot at batch start (NOT a live view, important for same-batch-bypass safety).
2. Merger is built from the state schema passed as `stateSchema` (a Zod object whose fields carry reducer metadata via `withLangGraph`, OR a LangGraph `Annotation.Root`). Each field's reducer is extracted from its channel's `BinaryOperatorAggregate.operator`; a Zod schema's channels are resolved through the langgraph zod registry to the same channel classes. The `messages` field is explicitly skipped (the runner emits its own `ToolMessage` at the end). When any confirm gate or bounded choice is configured, the runner also resolves the **caller-turn identity** here (`getCallerTurnId`, defaulting to the latest human message id — see `<caller_turn_identity>`).
3. **Admission** (`run/admission.ts`) — every whole-batch precondition, in a FIXED order, each able to refuse the batch (a single result entry, `failed_at: 0`, nothing committed):
   a. **Unknown action** — hallucinated/typo'd names get a structured refusal.
   b. **Choice same-turn lock** — a bounded choice resolved on THIS caller turn keeps domain work locked until the caller speaks again.
   c. **Choice pending lockdown** — a pending bounded choice admits only its controls / abort / handoff / configured direct inputs.
   d. **Gate lockdown** — a pending confirmation/OTP/match admits only its target action / abort / handoff / choice controls (+ the capturer, for match; see lockdown table above).
   e. **Flow mutex** — first step `startsFlow=X` while `currentFlow.name=Y` (≠X) → refuse `flow_already_active`.
   f. **Control exclusivity** — sole-step control families (handoff, bounded-choice) refuse to share a batch.
   g. **soleStep / soleOnExecute** — per-action batch-shape refusal (computed off batch-start pending so the LLM-natural `[verify, mutate]` batch can propose).
4. **Plan expansion** (`run/planning.ts`) — tag each user step with its confirmation mode (`propose` | `rePropose` | `execute` | `sameTurnLocked` | `exhausted`) based on pending state at batch-start. Frozen before any executor runs (same-batch-bypass safety). Planning is **abort-aware**: confirm steps AFTER an `abort_pending_input` in the same batch plan against NO pending — they propose fresh instead of executing against the gate the batch just cleared.
5. For each planned step (`run/execution.ts`):
   a. Control steps (`abort_pending_input`, `request_handoff`, the bounded-choice controls) dispatch to their `ControlAction` implementation, not an executor.
   b. Library-managed prereqs (`requiresFlow`, then `requiresOtp` / `requiresMatch`) → refuse if not gated.
   c. User-declared prereqs (verifiers) → refuse with denial body.
   d. Validate params via `paramsSchema.parse`.
   e. Run the action's selector against the running `view` to build the slice, then call the executor: `executors[action](params, selectors[action](view))`. If the executor throws, the runner catches it, marks the step `ok:false` (`error: "executor_error"`), and short-circuits — earlier steps' commits are preserved.
   f. Apply executor outputs in this order: `stateUpdate` (host slots only — library slots throw) → `request_handoff` effect (terminal; skips the rest) → `startsFlow` + `merge_flow_data` → `otp_issued` → auto-clear of `requiresOtp`/`requiresMatch` on ok → `startsMatchFor` → `endsFlow` → `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow`. On ok:false + `verdict:"match_mismatch"`, decrement match attempts (or abort flow on exhaustion). **Handoff monotonicity:** once the `handoff` slot is set (control or effect), the remaining interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch ends after the current step, whatever `ok` was.
6. **Finalize** (`run/finalize.ts`) — build the result body, apply the error-counter/auto-handoff policy, and emit a single `ToolMessage` whose content is the JSON-stringified `RunnerResultBody = { summary, results, failed_at? }`.

**Cumulative commit on partial failure:** state patches from successful earlier steps DO commit even if a later step fails. Example: `[verify_customer (ok), verify_card (fail)]` → `verifiedCustomer` persists for the next turn.

**Crucial:** state slots in the graph's `state.ts` MUST declare an explicit reducer (`Annotation<T>({ reducer, default })`). The library reads the reducer at runtime. Slots declared without a reducer get replace-on-write behavior (which is fine — but be explicit about it).
</state_threading>

<confirmation_lifecycle>
## Mutation propose → execute lifecycle (when `requiresConfirmation` is set)

The runner switches the mutation action into a five-mode state machine. Detected by reading `awaitingInput.kind === "confirmation"`:

**Ordering with prereqs (non-obvious, but guaranteed).** A step's library prereqs (`requiresFlow`) and user verifiers run BEFORE its confirmation mode is acted on (`<state_threading>` step 5b/5c, ahead of the propose in 5f). So a confirm-gated mutation whose `requiresFlow`/prereqs are unmet is **refused, not proposed** — `awaitingInput` is never set into a doomed state. Compose `requiresConfirmation` with `requiresFlow` freely; the gate order is correct.

### First call (no pending, or pending action ≠ this action) → **propose mode**
- Parse params with the action's **effective schema** (the declared `paramsSchema`, page-extended for `pageable` actions) and store them **PARSED** — schema normalization (`z.preprocess`, coercion) is applied before storage: `awaitingInput = { kind: "confirmation", for_action, params, attempts_left: maxAttempts, max_attempts, proposed_on_caller_turn_id? }`. The proposal is stamped with the current caller-turn identity when one exists (see `<caller_turn_identity>`).
- A failed parse returns `{ ok: false, error: "invalid_params" }` with the overridable `invalid_params` system-message summary and the raw Zod detail in `_debug` (nothing is stored).
- Return `{ ok: true, summary, needs_confirmation: true, proposed_params, attempts_left }`, plus **`read_back`** when the action declares `ConfirmationOpts.readBack` and it renders a non-empty string for these parsed params (2.3.0). Absent — not empty — when it renders nothing.
- **Executor is NOT invoked.**

### Re-call whose params **parse to the pending proposal**, on a LATER caller turn → **execute mode**
- The incoming RAW params are parsed with the same effective schema, then compared (deep value equality) against the stored parsed proposal — value normalization never reads as drift (e.g. a `z.preprocess` stripping STT separators: `"70,76"` ≡ `"7076"`). A failed parse counts as drift (→ rePropose).
- Clear `awaitingInput` atomically BEFORE invoking the executor.
- Invoke the executor with the parsed params + view.
- Whatever the executor returns is the result (the executor performs its own pre-read + write + post-read).

### Matching re-call on the SAME caller turn → **sameTurnLocked** (2.0.0)
- The proposal carries `proposed_on_caller_turn_id`; a matching re-call while that turn is still current means the caller has NOT actually answered the read-back — the model is confirming with itself. Refused with `error: "confirmation_same_turn_locked"`: no attempt is spent, the gate stays untouched, and execution requires a re-call on a later caller turn.
- Enforced only when both turn identities exist. Identity-less direct `runSteps` consumers (state fixtures without message ids) keep the pre-2.0 params-only behavior. **Test-harness implication:** manual propose → execute sequences must simulate the caller's answering turn — append a fresh human message id between the two calls (the bootstrap harness ships `answeredTurn` / `runConfirmed` helpers for exactly this).

### Re-call with **genuinely different params** (or params that fail to parse) → **rePropose mode**
- Update `awaitingInput.params` to the newly parsed params, decrement `attempts_left`.
- If the re-call's params fail to parse: the step fails with `invalid_params` (summary = the overridable system message, raw Zod detail in `_debug`) and the pending proposal is left **unchanged** — no decrement, the prior proposal still stands.
- If `attempts_left > 0`: return new `needs_confirmation` envelope with decremented `attempts_left` — including a fresh `read_back` rendered from the CORRECTED params, so the caller hears what actually replaced the old value.
- If `attempts_left === 0`: return `{ ok: false, summary, error: "confirmation_attempts_exhausted" }` and clear pending.

### Lockdown
If `awaitingInput.kind === "confirmation"` and `lockdown: true` (default), the batch MUST start with either:
- The same action as the pending one (resolves to execute / rePropose / exhausted), OR
- `abort_pending_input` (library-handled; clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow`; abort may be the first step of a larger batch — subsequent steps run after the gate clears).

Anything else → `{ ok: false, error: "pending_confirmation_locked", awaiting: { kind, for_action } }`.

### abort_pending_input
Library auto-injects this action into the schema whenever ANY lifecycle opt is declared. It is library-handled (no executor needed):
- If `awaitingInput` or `currentFlow` is set → clear both; return `{ ok: true, summary: "Pending input and/or flow aborted.", aborted_awaiting?, aborted_flow? }`.
- If nothing is active → no-op; return `{ ok: true, summary: "Nothing to abort." }`.
</confirmation_lifecycle>

<invalidates_on_change>
## Downstream-slot invalidation (`ActionDef.invalidatesOnChange`)

A per-action map declaring "if this action re-collects slot X with a *different* value, reset everything derived from X to `null`." Keys are slot names the action may write; values are the downstream slots to clear.

```ts
verify_customer: {
  // …
  invalidatesOnChange: {
    customerCode: ["cardVerified", "amountCollected", "reasoningCollected", /* … */],
  },
},
```

Fire rule (evaluated after the executor's `stateUpdate` has been folded in):
- Fires only when the watched slot's pre-step value was **non-null** AND the written value is not **deep-VALUE-equal** to it (canonicalized-JSON compare — reference identity never counts, so an executor writing a fresh-but-value-equal object does NOT fire).
- First-time set (`null → value`) does NOT fire — there was nothing downstream to invalidate yet.
- Same-value writes (no real change) do NOT fire — including a fresh object with identical contents.
- Slots set later in the same batch are NOT retro-cleared; an executor's own writes to a downstream slot win over the cascade.

Invalidated slots are written as `null` regardless of their declared type, so any slot listed as a target must accept `null` as its "unset" sentinel. CAUTION: the `null` must also survive the HOST's reducer for that slot — list only **replace-on-write** slots as invalidation targets. A record-merge reducer (`{...prev, ...(next ?? {})}`) swallows the `null` at the graph boundary, so the slot resurrects on the next turn even though the in-batch view saw it cleared.
</invalidates_on_change>

<otp_lifecycle>
## OTP gate (when `issuesOtp` / `requiresOtp` are set)

Two actions cooperate: the **issuer** mints an SCA challenge; the **consumer** validates the customer's OTP. Library coordinates `awaitingInput.kind === "otp"`.

### Issuer (`controller.issuesOtp = { consumer_action }`)
- Executor calls the SCA backend to mint a challenge.
- On `ok: true`, the executor returns `effects: [{ type: "otp_issued" }, { type: "merge_flow_data", data: { challengeId, customerId, ... } }]` — the merge carries the challenge details so the consumer can read them from `currentFlow.data`; surface caller-facing bits (e.g. a masked mobile) in `resultBody`.
- Library sets `awaitingInput = { kind: "otp", for_action: consumer_action, flow_ref: currentFlow.name }`.

Issuer typically also declares `startsFlow: { name: "X" }` so the OTP gate is tied to a flow.

**Match-then-OTP ordering guard.** An `issuesOtp` step is refused (pre-execution, so the SCA backend is never called) when a double-entry **match** gate is still pending in the live view — error `otp_blocked_match_pending`. This enforces "at most one input gate at a time, match before OTP": without it, a `[capturer, issuer]` batch would mint+send the OTP and overwrite the still-pending match gate, skipping the second entry entirely. The check reads the **live** view (not batch-start), so the legitimate `[consumer, issuer]` batch still works — the consumer clears the match earlier in the same batch, so no match is pending by the time the issuer runs.

### Consumer (`controller.requiresOtp = true`)
- Refused unless `awaitingInput.kind === "otp" && for_action === <this action>`. Error: `otp_not_pending` if the gate isn't pending; `otp_pending_locked` if something else is awaiting.
- Executor reads `challengeId` (etc.) from `state.currentFlow.data`, calls SCA validate.
- Library **does not count OTP attempts**. The backend is authoritative for lock / timeout / wrong:
  - **valid** → executor returns `ok: true`; library auto-clears `awaitingInput`. Flow continues.
  - **wrong, retry allowed** → executor returns `ok: false` (no effects). Library leaves state alone; customer re-reads the same code.
  - **timeout** → executor returns `ok: false, effects: [{ type: "clear_awaiting_input" }]`. The gate dies; the LLM offers to resend (re-call the issuer to mint a fresh challenge).
  - **lockout** → executor returns `ok: false, effects: [{ type: "abort_flow" }]`. The flow is dead; library clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow`.

### Single consumer, multiple issuers
A single `confirm_otp` action can serve every OTP-protected flow in the tool. Each issuer points its `issuesOtp.consumer_action` at that one consumer, and the consumer reads `currentFlow.data` to know which challenge is in play.
</otp_lifecycle>

<match_lifecycle>
## Double-entry match gate (when `startsMatchFor` / `requiresMatch` are set)

The customer provides a value once, then again; the system verifies they match. Used for PIN setup, password change, secret-answer confirmation. Library coordinates `awaitingInput.kind === "match"`.

### Capturer (`controller.startsMatchFor = { consumer_action }`)
- Executor validates/encodes/persists the first entry (typically into flow data, via a `merge_flow_data` effect).
- On `ok: true`, library sets `awaitingInput = { kind: "match", for_action: consumer_action, attempts_left: maxAttempts, max_attempts: maxAttempts, flow_ref? }`.
- Re-running the capturer while a match is awaiting **resets** `attempts_left` (lets the customer change their first entry).

### Consumer (`controller.requiresMatch = { capturer, maxAttempts }`)
- Refused unless `awaitingInput.kind === "match" && for_action === <this action>`. Error: `match_not_pending` if absent.
- **Same-batch double-entry is refused (batch-start freeze).** The gate check reads the awaiting-input snapshot as it stood at **batch start**, not the live in-batch view — so a match gate the capturer opens *earlier in the same batch* is NOT consumable by the consumer in that same batch. The double-entry repeat must arrive in a SEPARATE turn (mirrors the confirmation same-batch-bypass protection). A `[capturer, consumer]` batch fails at the consumer with `match_not_pending`; the legitimate `[consumer, issuer]` batch is unaffected (the consumer's gate was opened in a prior turn, so it IS present at batch start).
- Executor receives the second entry, owns the comparison (e.g. compares ciphertexts), performs the side-effect on match.
- Library reads the executor's outcome:
  - `ok: true` → match succeeded; library auto-clears `awaitingInput`. Pair with `endsFlow: true` to wrap the flow.
  - `ok: false` + `resultBody.verdict === "match_mismatch"` → library decrements `attempts_left`. On exhaustion, library clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow` (terminal) and surfaces `verdict: "match_attempts_exhausted"`, `error: "match_attempts_exhausted"`.
  - `ok: false` + any other verdict → library leaves state alone (unrelated failure, e.g. backend error).

### Lockdown
While `awaitingInput.kind === "match"`, only three actions are allowed as the first step: the consumer, the capturer (re-capture), or `abort_pending_input`.
</match_lifecycle>

<caller_turn_identity>
## Caller-turn identity (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.getCallerTurnId`)

Four protections key on a **stable identity for the latest caller turn**: the confirmation gate's same-turn lock (`<confirmation_lifecycle>`), the bounded choice's offered-this-turn lock, the bounded choice's resolved-this-turn lock (`<bounded_choice>`), and — since 2.3.0 — the host guard latch (`guardTurn`). By default the runner resolves it as the **latest human/user message id** in `state.messages` — LangGraph's messages reducer assigns missing ids before a node sees state, so this is stable across every ReAct loop within one caller turn and independent of history length.

- Hosts that **compact or replace messages** must provide `getCallerTurnId: (state) => string | null | undefined` returning a stable, non-compacted turn token.
- When no identity exists (e.g. direct `runSteps` calls with message-less fixtures), the confirmation same-turn guard is **deliberately unavailable** (params-only behavior) — the runner never guesses. Bounded-choice **resolution**, by contrast, **fails closed** (`bounded_choice_turn_identity_unavailable`): recording a selection requires knowing which turn it happened on.
- The hook (and the message scan) is only consulted when a confirm gate or bounded choice is actually configured — hosts using neither never pay for it.
- **`resolveCallerTurnId(state, getCallerTurnId?)` is exported** (2.3.0) so hosts stop re-deriving this. It returns the host hook's value when configured, else the latest human message id; blank/whitespace collapses to `undefined` (identity unavailable). The guard latch is built on it — pass the same `getCallerTurnId` you gave `buildAgentStepTool`, or the two halves will disagree about where a turn starts.
</caller_turn_identity>

<bounded_choice>
## Bounded-choice overlay (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.boundedChoices`)

An opt-in, **engine-owned, one-shot conversational choice** layered OVER whatever domain gate is pending. Use it when the conversation must fork on a meta-question ("do you want to continue with X, or stop?") without clearing or unlocking a suspended confirmation/OTP/match — the original gate stays authoritative underneath. The host prompt decides WHEN the configured choice applies; the runner owns its persisted pending/resolved state, locks, and repeat fallback.

```ts
// BuildAgentStepToolOptions.boundedChoices: BoundedChoiceRegistry
type BoundedChoiceRegistry = Record<string, BoundedChoiceDef>;

interface BoundedChoiceDef {
  description: string;                     // model-facing: when/why to offer this choice
  selections: readonly string[];           // the nonterminal resolutions the runner may record
                                           // (e.g. ["continue"]). Terminal alternative = the
                                           // built-in request_handoff action.
  directInputActions?: readonly string[];  // domain actions allowed to CONSUME a pending choice
                                           // because the caller supplied the exact detail the
                                           // suspended question asked for. Everything else stays
                                           // locked until resolve_bounded_choice runs.
  onRepeatHandoff?: HandoffRequest;        // atomic handoff fallback when the model re-requests
                                           // an already-used choice (requires the handoff opt).
}
```

Providing a non-empty registry injects two library-owned **controls** into the tool schema (both exported as constants): **`request_bounded_choice`** (`REQUEST_BOUNDED_CHOICE_ACTION`) and **`resolve_bounded_choice`** (`RESOLVE_BOUNDED_CHOICE_ACTION`). Both names become reserved. The policy, stated once:

- **One-shot.** Once a choice has been requested it can never be offered again (`bounded_choice_already_used`). With `onRepeatHandoff` configured, a repeat request atomically emits that handoff instead of refusing. A `resolved` choice persists in the slot until the surrounding flow ends or a terminal handoff clears it.
- **Lockdown while pending.** Only the choice controls, `abort_pending_input`, `request_handoff`, and the configured `directInputActions` may run (`bounded_choice_pending_locked` otherwise). This is what prevents a meta-level "continue" from becoming consent for a suspended permanent mutation if the model emits the wrong action.
- **Offered-this-turn lock.** The request control stamps `requested_on_caller_turn_id`; while that turn is current, `resolve_bounded_choice` and direct-input consumption are refused (`bounded_choice_same_turn_locked`) — the caller must actually hear the fork and reply before anything counts as their selection. Abort / handoff / repeat-request stay available.
- **Resolved-this-turn lock.** A nonterminal resolution records `resolved_on_caller_turn_id`; domain work stays locked while that turn is current (`bounded_choice_resume_turn_locked`), so a second ReAct loop in the SAME turn cannot execute suspended work. Resolution **fails closed** without a stable turn identity (`bounded_choice_turn_identity_unavailable`) — see `<caller_turn_identity>`.
- **Consume-on-acceptance.** A pending choice is consumed as `domain_input` only when a direct-input step is ACCEPTED (flow gate + prereqs + params all passed; a confirm propose counts). `invalid_params` / prereq denials do NOT burn the one-shot.
- `resolve_bounded_choice` with nothing pending → `bounded_choice_not_pending`; an unknown selection is an `invalid_params` refusal.

The registry is validated at construction: non-empty names/descriptions/selections, no duplicate selections, `directInputActions` must name real actions, `onRepeatHandoff` requires the `handoff` opt (see `<construction_time_checks>`).
</bounded_choice>

<pagination>
## Read pagination (`pageable`)

A LIST read opts in with `pageable` on its `ActionDef`. The runner then injects optional `page` / `pageSize` params into the action's schema (so the model can ask for a page), runs/serves the read, and emits a **uniform envelope** spread into the StepResult:

```ts
{ page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages, hasMore, items, fromCache }
```

The executor's other `resultBody` fields (e.g. `summary`) are preserved on every page, including cache hits. Two modes:

- **`pageable: true`** — **self-paginate.** The executor returns the **FULL set** in `resultBody.items`; the runner slices the requested page and caches the full set in the library-managed `pagedRead` slot. A same-query re-page (same params minus `page`/`pageSize`) is served from the cache **without re-running the executor** (`fromCache: true`).
- **`pageable: "delegate"`** — **backend pages.** The executor reads the injected `page`/`pageSize`, returns that page in `resultBody.items` plus `resultBody.totalCount`; the runner just wraps it (no cache).
- **`pageable: { mode, pageSize?, maxPageSize? }`** — same, with tuned sizes (defaults: `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=10`, `MAX_PAGE_SIZE=50`).

**Constraint:** a `pageable` action's `paramsSchema` MUST be a `z.object` (the runner merges `page`/`pageSize` in) — otherwise construction throws.

**Primitives** (exported from `index.ts`, for hand-rolled cases — the runner uses them internally): `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`, `clampPageSize`, `querySignature`, `pageRows`, `buildPageEnvelope`, and types `PageEnvelope`, `PagedCache`, `PageableSpec`. Prefer the `pageable` opt over hand-rolling.
</pagination>

<caller_digit_capture>
## Caller-digit capture (`digitsOnly` / `callerDigits` / `digitGroupsParam` / `digitCandidatesParam`)

Schema helpers for params that carry **caller-dictated digits** (a tax number, a card-number tail, an OTP-adjacent code). Unlike `paginate.ts` — whose primitives the runner itself uses — this module is **authoring-only**: nothing in the runner calls it. It lives in the library because each rule below is a consequence of a runner contract, so a host that hand-rolls the field re-derives (or misses) them one live failure at a time:

- **Shape rules are refinements, never `.regex()`.** A `.regex()` becomes a `pattern` keyword in the model-facing JSON Schema, turning the tool's validation into a precondition the model must satisfy before it may call. The model then counts digits itself — unreliable on grouped STT captures — and either **withholds the call** (answers the caller instead; a valid capture never reaches the tool) or **pads an invented digit** to satisfy the pattern. `callerDigits(shape, message)` keeps the wire type a plain `string`; the runner's propose-path parse bounces a bad shape as recoverable `invalid_params` — before any read-back, without spending a confirmation attempt.
- **Refinement messages carry no digit count.** Issue text rides the StepResult's `_debug` back to the model; "must be exactly 9 digits" re-introduces through the error path the very constraint the refinement keeps out of the schema, precisely on the turn where the model is about to re-ask. Say WHAT failed ("not a usable capture"), never HOW MANY DIGITS. The ban is on the VALUE's length: a count of something else — how many alternative readings `maxCandidates` allows, say — tells the model nothing about the digits and is fine.
- **Representation flips must not read as drift.** The confirmation gate compares schema-PARSED params, so `["7070"]` ≡ `"7070"` and separator variants must normalize identically — the separator strip and the singleton-array collapse live in the preprocess, before the compare.
- **The declared type is the honest wire union.** A field that accepts digit GROUPS carries the array branch in its TYPE — a preprocess is invisible to the model's schema and to shape-only wrapper validation, and with a bare string type a group-array call bounces as a raw schema error instead of the runner's voice-safe `invalid_params`.

Two field builders (both take a **required** `describe` — the library ships NO model-facing wording; field text is live prompt surface, owned and QA-gated per host):

- **`digitGroupsParam({ shape, message, describe })`** — the "transcription field": the model transcribes one array entry per **spoken digit group** («δεκαεπτά, είκοσι ένα, πενήντα δύο, δύο, ογδόντα δύο» → `["17","21","52","2","82"]`) or a single string; the JOIN happens in the preprocess, never in the model (models regroup, drop repeated groups, and lose the zero of round tens). `shape` validates the JOINED value. Omission stays `undefined` — the host's channel for "consume a carried/collected value".
- **`digitCandidatesParam({ shape, message, candidateMessage?, maxCandidates?, describe })`** — the ambiguous-reading field: a single digit string, or an array of EVERY plausible reading of one utterance («χίλια τρία» → `["1003","10003"]`) for the executor to try — the model never picks a reading itself.

**Description authoring (the part the host owns).** The proven register for `describe` — adapt, don't invent:
- Frame the field as **pure transcription** ("you are a stenographer here"): write down the digit groups exactly as heard, in spoken order; never concatenate, merge, regroup, shorten, extend, count, or judge; a group is never dropped because it repeats its neighbour; the SYSTEM sanitizes, joins, and does ALL validation, answering `invalid_params` on an unusable capture.
- Keep the field **semantically neutral**: naming the domain entity ("the AFM") or its length ("nine digits") re-activates the model's world knowledge — the measured source of withheld calls and reshaped captures no prompt scrub fully suppresses.
- Give 2–3 concrete renderings in the caller's language(s), e.g. `«10, 2, 22. 8078» → ["10","2","22","8078"]`.
- If omission consumes a carried value, say exactly that ("Omit the field entirely to consume …") — omission semantics belong in the field text, not only the prompt.

<handoff>
## Library-coordinated channel handoff (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff`)

Opt-in machinery for a SPECIALIZED agent's off-topic plays (see `streaming-and-channel-contract.md` `<agent_roles>`): delegate the turn to another deployment and keep the conversation, or hand the conversation back. Two cooperating halves — the runner writes a slot; a host graph node resolves it.

### Runner half (opt-in)

Pass `handoff: HandoffSpec<T>` to `buildAgentStepTool`. The runner then:

- Auto-injects the reserved **`request_handoff`** control into the tool schema (with the opt provided, declaring it in `config.actions` throws; WITHOUT the opt the name is free — the orchestrator/scaffold mechanism uses it for its own action). Params = `HandoffRequestSchema`: `{ reason: "off_topic" | "completed" | "abandon", context }` — `context` is the customer's request for `off_topic`, the LLM-composed closing line for `completed` / `abandon`.
- Handles the action internally as an **atomic slot transition** — validates params, clears every transient runner slot (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `boundedChoice`, `pagedRead`), writes the `handoff` slot into view + committed state, and returns an ok result telling the model the turn ends here. No I/O in the runner. An **executor** requests the same terminal transition (identical atomic cleanup) via the `request_handoff` effect — never by writing the slot through `stateUpdate`, which throws.
- Enforces **exclusivity**: batched with anything else ⇒ the whole batch is refused with `error: "handoff_must_be_sole_step"`, nothing executes.
- **No prereqs**, and allowed as the first step under input lockdown (pending confirmation / OTP / match) — "transfer me" must work before any data is loaded and cannot be blocked by a pending gate.

### Graph half (`createHandoffNode`)

                                     // construction throws without it. See below.
}
```

**`resolveClosingMessage`** lets the host gate the spoken closing on what actually happened: e.g. only
speak a success line for `completed` when the mutating action truly persisted, otherwise return a
neutral/failed phrasing. It runs in `createHandoffNode` for `completed` / `abandon` only; a returned
string becomes the final message `content` (and `handoff_metadata.success_message`), `undefined` falls
through to `request.context`.

**State can decide the signal and the metadata (2.3.0).** `resolveHandoffType` is resolved **before the
first control-plane event**, so the `handoff` custom event, the closing line, `handoff_type` and
`handoff_metadata.service_type` all carry one value. That ordering is the point: hosts previously
overrode the signal by mutating the resolved message's `additional_kwargs` from OUTSIDE — a shape this
library documents as a frozen channel contract — which left the event carrying the PRE-override reason.
An override can only swap `completed` ↔ `abandon`; it can never produce or erase an `off_topic`, so
delegate detection and the clearing gate below are unaffected by construction. `resolveHandoffMetadata`
is the same move for host-derived fields: they are spread FIRST and the library's keys applied last, so
a host cannot clobber the contract. No extra toggle is needed for either — omit the field for the host,
return `undefined` for one resolution; a rollout kill-switch belongs in the host function.

**A handoff can be FORCED from state (2.3.0).** `forcedHandoff` covers the turn where state already says
the task is over but the model answered in plain text. Wire `forcedHandoffRequested(state, spec)` on the
MODEL node's conditional edge ahead of `END`; `createHandoffNode` then re-derives the same request from
the same pure function (`state.handoff ?? spec.forcedHandoff?.(state)`), so predicate and resolver cannot
disagree, the graph needs no arming node, and **the forced request is never written to state** — no host
code goes near the library-managed `handoff` slot. A pending slot always wins: the guard never overrides
a handoff the model actually requested.

> **The re-fire trap.** `forcedHandoff` runs on every turn the model answers in text. If it derives its
> decision from a TERMINAL domain slot that is not listed in `clearsOnHandback`, it fires again on every
> later turn of the same call and the caller is bounced with no way out. Adopting `forcedHandoff` and
> declaring `clearsOnHandback` are one change, not two.

**Task-scoped state is cleared when the task ends (2.2.0).** The THREAD outlives the TASK: a channel
middleware reuses one thread id for a whole call and never resets it on re-dispatch, so whatever sits
in state when a handback resolves is what the NEXT task on that thread starts from. On `completed` /
`abandon` in terminate mode, `createHandoffNode` therefore nulls the library's own
`agentStepTaskScopedSlots` (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `boundedChoice`, `pagedRead`, `errorCount`)
plus every domain slot the host named in **`clearsOnHandback`**. Two carve-outs, both correctness
invariants rather than preferences, so neither is configurable: **`off_topic` clears nothing** (a
mid-task aside must stay resumable — the caller can come straight back), and **a successful delegate
clears nothing** (the conversation never left this agent). The closing line, the signal, and any
`resolveClosingMessage` reading state are all computed before the clear, so the reply is unaffected.

Declare `clearsOnHandback` when the host graph derives anything from a terminal domain slot — a forced
handback, an escalation, a "this task already finished" branch. Left undeclared, such a slot survives
into the next task and re-fires its branch on every later turn of the same call. Slots whose reducer
MERGES cannot be cleared this way (the write is a plain `null`); reset those through the pointer slot
that selects from them.

**One free aside deflection before the handback (2.4.0).** `deflectAside` opts into the
`deflect_aside` control — a damper for the trigger-happy `off_topic` handoff on a social aside
mid-task (weather, small talk — chit-chat NO configured agent serves, where a re-route buys the
caller nothing but a lost turn). Params: `{ aside: string }` (the caller's off-task request, in the
caller's language). The CLASSIFICATION stays with the model — a topic another configured agent may
serve still goes to `request_handoff` with `off_topic`; only nobody-serves-it chit-chat is deflected
— while the POLICY is engine-owned:

- **First use per task:** no handoff. The task-scoped `deflectedAside` latch is set, every pending
  gate/flow survives untouched (the control is allowed during gate lockdown and choice-pending, like
  the handoff), and the step result instructs the model (`SystemMessages.aside_deflected`) to decline
  in ONE short sentence and repeat its pending question in the SAME turn.
- **Repeat in the same task:** the free deflection is spent — the control escalates ATOMICALLY into
  the `off_topic` handback (the same slot transition `request_handoff` performs), with the aside as
  the routing `context`. One-shot, like the bounded-choice overlay: a caller who keeps pivoting away
  still re-routes deterministically, with no window where the model must issue a second call.

Misclassification is benign in both directions: an in-scope ask wrongly deflected hands off one turn
later on persistence; chit-chat wrongly sent through `request_handoff` is exactly the pre-control
behaviour. `deflect_aside` must be the SOLE step in its batch (`deflect_must_be_sole_step`) and is a
reserved name only when enabled. The latch is task-scoped: a task-ENDING handback clears it (next
task gets its own freebie), but an `off_topic` roundtrip deliberately does NOT re-arm it. Enabling
the control makes the `deflectedAside` channel REQUIRED at construction — without it the latch write
would be silently discarded and the escalation would never fire, so `buildAgentStepTool` refuses to
construct. The host prompt must teach the split (which topics other agents serve vs. chit-chat) —
the domain-neutral default description (`DEFLECT_ASIDE_ACTION_DESCRIPTION`) can't know the fleet, so
a real deployment usually states its own policy via `deflectAside: { actionDescription }`.

Exports: `DEFLECT_ASIDE_ACTION` (`"deflect_aside"`), `DEFLECT_ASIDE_ACTION_DESCRIPTION` (the
domain-neutral default the object form overrides), plus `HANDOFF_ACTION` (`"request_handoff"`), `HANDOFF_NODE` (`"resolve_handoff"` — a node can't be named `handoff`, the state channel claims it), `HANDBACK_SIGNALS` (reason → `handoff_type` signal; identity over `off_topic` / `completed` / `abandon`), `handoffParamsSchema`, `handoffRequested(state)` (edge predicate), `forcedHandoffRequested(state, spec)` (the forced-handoff edge predicate — true when nothing is pending yet `spec.forcedHandoff` derives one), `createHandoffNode(spec)`.

Wire a conditional edge after the tool node — `createReactAgent` cannot express it, so the graph is hand-rolled: `addConditionalEdges("tools", s => handoffRequested(s) ? HANDOFF_NODE : "agent")`, `addNode(HANDOFF_NODE, createHandoffNode(spec))`, `addEdge(HANDOFF_NODE, END)`. A host using `forcedHandoff` adds one more predicate on the MODEL node's own edge — `forcedHandoffRequested(s, spec) ? HANDOFF_NODE : END` — and still no extra node. The node emits a `handoff` custom event FIRST (streaming clients abort TTS / reroute before any content), resolves the response (terminate envelope, or a delegate run over the Platform API with live `delegated_token` pass-through and a behavioral fallback to the envelope on failure), emits `handoff_complete`, and returns `{ handoff: null, ...clears, messages: [AIMessage] }` (the clears are empty unless a task-ending handback resolved — see above) — the model never paraphrases the result.

**Final-message kwargs** (the channel contract): every non-delegate resolution is a handback — `is_handoff: true`, `handoff_type` = the effective reason's signal (`off_topic` / `completed` / `abandon`, after any `resolveHandoffType`), `handoff_reason` = `context`, `handoff_metadata: { ...host fields from resolveHandoffMetadata, service_type, success_message }` — host fields first, library keys last and unclobberable. Spoken content: the `off_topic` envelope (`terminateMessage`, also the delegate-failure fallback) or the LLM-composed closing in `context` for `completed` / `abandon` (the middleware delivers it and flips routing for the NEXT request). Delegate success → NOT a handoff (conversation kept) — informational `{ delegated_to }` only. Streaming clients must request `stream_mode: ["messages-tuple", "custom"]` — the node-built final message never appears in the token stream; `handoff_complete` carries its text. Full wire details + the middleware checklist: `streaming-and-channel-contract.md`.

<system_messages>
## Runner-emitted system messages (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.messages`)

The runner emits its own `summary` strings for structured refusals/errors it raises directly (not from an executor): executor crash, invalid params, unknown action, the abort outcomes, the flow gates, the lockdown/batch-shape refusals, and the confirmation/OTP/match gate outcomes. **Every runner-emitted summary is overridable** (since 1.8.0). These ship as **neutral English defaults** in `src/agent-step/messages.ts` so the library has ZERO dependency on any host project.

```ts
interface SystemMessages {
  executor_error: string;     // an executor threw / hard failure (raw cause in `_debug`)
  invalid_params: string;     // step params failed schema validation (raw detail in `_debug`)
  unknown_action: string;     // a hallucinated/typo'd action name reached the runner
  flow_already_active: string;// tried to open a flow while a different flow is active
  no_flow: string;            // a flow-scoped step ran with no flow active
  wrong_flow: string;         // a flow-scoped step ran against the wrong flow
  abort_done: string;         // abort_pending_input cleared a pending gate / active flow
  abort_nothing: string;      // abort_pending_input ran with nothing pending (no-op)
  auto_handoff: string;       // spoken when the auto-handoff threshold is hit (see <auto_handoff>)

  // Templated summaries (1.8.0) — may carry `{placeholder}` tokens the runner
  // interpolates at emit time (via `formatMessage`; unknown placeholders stay
  // verbatim so a bad override is visible, not silently blanked). Overrides
  // are plain strings, so they can live in a host's JSON locale resources.
  lockdown_confirmation: string;         // {action} {abort_action}
  lockdown_otp: string;                  // {action} {abort_action}
  lockdown_match: string;                // {action} {capturer} {abort_action}
  handoff_must_be_sole_step: string;     // {action}
  mutation_must_be_sole_step: string;    // {action}
  mutation_execute_must_be_sole: string; // {action}
  mutation_must_be_last_in_batch: string;// {action}
  confirm_proposed: string;              // {action}
  confirm_reproposed: string;            // {action}
  confirm_exhausted: string;             // {action}

  match_not_pending: string;             // {action} {capturer}
  otp_blocked_match_pending: string;     // {action} {match_action}
  match_attempts_exhausted: string;      // {action}
  handoff_requested: string;             // {reason}
  aside_deflected: string;               // (no placeholders) the deflect_aside control accepted the
                                         // task's ONE free deflection: instructs the model to decline
                                         // the aside in one short sentence and repeat its pending
                                         // question in the SAME turn. Model-facing, not caller-audible.
  no_steps: string;                      // (no placeholders)
  auto_handoff_instruction: string;      // {message} — see <auto_handoff>
}
```

A host overrides any subset via `buildAgentStepTool({ messages })` (`Partial<SystemMessages>`, **shallow-merged** over `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`). Use this for localized / voice-safe wording on a TTS or non-English agent. The library never imports host strings; the host injects them.

Exports (from `index.ts`): `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`, `resolveSystemMessages(overrides?)`, type `SystemMessages`. Note these are the **runner's own** summaries only — an executor's `resultBody.summary` (the LLM-facing per-action text) is authored by the executor and is unaffected.

<auto_handoff>
## Auto-handoff on repeated backend failures

A safety net so a customer is never trapped in an unrecoverable backend-error loop. The runner keeps a consecutive **backend-failure** counter in the library-managed `errorCount` slot; when it reaches a threshold the runner auto-triggers a handoff.

**What counts as a backend failure.** The runner-raised **`executor_error`** (an executor threw, uncaught) ALWAYS counts. A host adds its own executor-returned verdict `error` codes via `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.backendFailureCodes` — list ONLY true backend/network failures there (e.g. `"service_error"`). User mistakes (wrong OTP, value mismatch) and business-logic refusals are recoverable and must NOT be listed, or the counter will escalate recoverable situations. The counter resets to 0 only when a batch in which an executor **actually ran** ends without a backend failure — executed work is the only proof the backend recovered. Batches where no executor ran (confirm-gate proposals/re-proposals, prereq or param refusals, aborts, handoff signals) are **neutral**: they neither increment nor reset, so the proposal a confirm gate interleaves between two failing executes cannot wipe the streak (without this, a confirm-gated action could never reach the threshold).

```ts
// BuildAgentStepToolOptions additions
backendFailureCodes?: string[];   // host verdicts that count (executor_error always counts)
errorHandoffThreshold?: number;   // default 3
onErrorThreshold?: (update: Record<string, unknown>, state: T) => void;
                                  // host hook fired at the threshold — inject a custom
                                  // handoff signal (e.g. write a scaffold `pendingHandoff` slot)
```

**At the threshold the runner:** (1) writes the library `handoff` slot `{ reason: "abandon", context: messages.auto_handoff }` when the `handoff` opt is enabled; (2) calls `onErrorThreshold(committed, state)` if provided; (3) resets `errorCount` to 0; (4) appends a synthetic step result `{ action: "auto_handoff", ok: true, isHandoff: true, signal: "abandon", successMessage: <auto_handoff> }`, sets `body.summary` to the **`auto_handoff_instruction`** template, and clears `failed_at`.

**Who speaks the closing.** The default `auto_handoff_instruction` tells the model the turn ends here and to produce NO further answer — **the platform delivers the closing** (a `createHandoffNode` graph speaks the handoff `context`; a scaffold/middleware host speaks `success_message` from the final-message kwargs). Instructing the model to voice it too invites double-speaking. A host whose graph does NOT deliver the closing overrides `auto_handoff_instruction` and uses the `{message}` placeholder (= the `auto_handoff` closing) to have the model speak it — restoring the pre-1.8.0 behavior.

**Inert by default.** The whole mechanism is skipped unless a handoff path exists — i.e. the `handoff` opt is provided OR `onErrorThreshold` is set. A tool with neither never touches `errorCount`. Customize the spoken line via the `auto_handoff` system message and the accompanying instruction via `auto_handoff_instruction` (`<system_messages>`).

## What the LLM sees per tool call

```ts
interface RunnerResultBody {
  summary: string;                 // last step's summary (success) OR failing step's summary
  results: StepResult[];           // one entry per executed step
  failed_at?: number;              // index into results where batch short-circuited
}

interface StepResult {
  action: string;
  ok: boolean;
  [key: string]: unknown;          // executor's resultBody fields spread in
}
```

The `summary` of a runner-emitted refusal/error (executor crash, invalid params, abort, flow gates) is a **host-overridable system message** — see `<system_messages>`. For the `executor_error` and `invalid_params` kinds the runner also attaches a **`_debug`** field carrying the raw technical cause (the thrown message / the Zod issue list), so the overridable `summary` can stay user-safe while the diagnostic detail is preserved for logs.

Library-injected fields on specific step kinds:
- `abort_pending_input` results carry `aborted_awaiting: { kind, for_action }` and/or `aborted_flow: "<name>"` when something was actually cleared.
- `executor_error` / `invalid_params` results carry `_debug` with the raw cause (the `summary` itself is the overridable system message).
- `issuesOtp` refused while a match gate is pending carries `error: "otp_blocked_match_pending"`.
- propose / re-propose results carry `needs_confirmation: true`, `proposed_params`, `attempts_left`, and — when the action declares `ConfirmationOpts.readBack` and it renders something — `read_back` (proposal-only; never on the executing re-call).
- exhausted results carry `error: "confirmation_attempts_exhausted"`.
- lockdown refusals carry `error: "pending_confirmation_locked" | "otp_pending_locked" | "match_pending_locked"` and `awaiting: { kind, for_action }`.
- match-mismatch results gain `attempts_left` (decremented) or `verdict: "match_attempts_exhausted"` on the last try.
- a matching confirm re-call on the proposal's own caller turn carries `error: "confirmation_same_turn_locked"` (no attempt spent; gate untouched).
- bounded-choice refusals carry `error: "bounded_choice_pending_locked" | "bounded_choice_same_turn_locked" | "bounded_choice_resume_turn_locked" | "bounded_choice_already_used" | "bounded_choice_not_pending" | "bounded_choice_turn_identity_unavailable"` per the policy in `<bounded_choice>`.

<construction_time_checks>
The runner validates the config + registries at construction. These all throw at startup before any user input — fix the misconfig before continuing:

| Error message contains | Cause |
|------------------------|-------|
| `requires \`stateSchema\`` | `stateSchema` not provided (the pre-2.0 `stateAnnotation` alias no longer exists) |
| `is a reserved action name` | You declared `abort_pending_input` in config.actions (or `request_handoff` while the `handoff` opt is provided, or a bounded-choice control name while `boundedChoices` is provided) |
| `expects a state selector at selectors["xxx"]` | `selectors` registry missing the action-name key for an action |
| `expects an executor at executors["xxx"]` | `executors` registry missing the action-name key for an action |
| `is missing a non-empty description` | An action lacks `description` |
| `verifiers["xxx"] was not provided` | A prereq referenced by some action has no verifier |
| `pageable action's paramsSchema must be a z.object` | A `pageable` action's `paramsSchema` isn't a `z.object` (the runner can't merge `page`/`pageSize` in) |
| `at least one action must be defined` | Empty `config.actions` |
| `declares startsMatchFor "X" but that consumer doesn't declare requiresMatch` | Capturer names a consumer that exists but lacks the `requiresMatch` hook (2.0.0: checked at construction, not mid-conversation) |
| `declares issuesOtp for "X" but no such action exists` | `issuesOtp.consumer_action` names a non-existent action (2.0.0) |
| `declares requiresMatch with capturer "X" but no such action exists` | `requiresMatch.capturer` names a non-existent action (2.0.0) |
| `the state schema is missing channel(s)` | Channel-completeness check (2.0.0): a library slot this configuration writes has no channel in the host schema — spread `agentStepZodShape` / `agentStepStateSpec` |
| `bounded choice "X" …` | Bounded-choice registry validation (2.0.0): empty name/description/selections, duplicate selections, unknown `directInputActions`, or `onRepeatHandoff` without the `handoff` opt |

Runtime errors raised by the runner (not construction-time, but loud):

| Error message contains | Cause |
|------------------------|-------|
| `wrote library-managed slot(s) … through stateUpdate` | Executor patched `awaitingInput` / `currentFlow` / `boundedChoice` / `pagedRead` / `deflectedAside` / `handoff` / `errorCount` via `stateUpdate` — request the transition as a typed effect instead |
| `requested merge_flow_data but no flow is active` | Executor emitted `merge_flow_data` without `startsFlow` and no flow is open |
| `reported otp_issued but no flow is active` | Issuer didn't pair with `startsFlow` |
| `reported otp_issued but config lacks issuesOtp opt` | Executor returned the effect but the action's config didn't declare `issuesOtp` |
| `otp_blocked_match_pending` (step error) | An `issuesOtp` step ran while a double-entry match gate was still pending — consume the match before issuing the OTP (see `<otp_lifecycle>`) |

Slot declaration is enforced at construction since 2.0.0 (the channel-completeness row above) — a state schema missing a required library slot fails at startup instead of silently dropping writes. Spreading `agentStepZodShape` into your Zod state schema (as the bootstrap state template does) brings all eight slots in together with their reducers.

<key_files_to_inspect>
For ground truth, read these files in the project (don't paraphrase — they ARE the contract):

- `src/agent-step/index.ts` — the public surface (only what's re-exported here is part of the API; the module layout below is internal)
- `src/agent-step/types.ts` — the authoring contracts: `ExecutorResult`, `ExecutorEffect`, `Executor`, registries, `ActionDef`, `ControllerHooks`, `Verifier`
- `src/agent-step/state.ts` — the library-managed slot schemas (`AwaitingInputSchema`, `CurrentFlowSchema`, `BoundedChoiceSchema`, `PagedCacheSchema`, `HandoffRequestSchema`) + the spreadable fragments (`agentStepZodShape`, `agentStepStateSpec`, `agentStepInternalSlotMask`)
- `src/agent-step/runner.ts` — the thin public entry points (`buildAgentStepTool`, `runSteps`); the machinery lives in the phase modules:
  - `compile/` — `validate.ts` (every construction-time check), `plan.ts` (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions` + the compiled plan), `schema.ts` / `describe.ts` (the model-facing schema + description)
  - `run/` — `admission.ts` (the fixed-order whole-batch preconditions), `planning.ts` (confirm-mode freeze), `execution.ts` (per-step loop, effects ordering, handoff monotonicity), `finalize.ts` (result body + error-counter policy), `batch-state.ts` (the single write path into view/committed)
  - `interaction/` — one policy module per gate kind: `confirmation.ts`, `otp.ts`, `match.ts`, `flow.ts`, `bounded-choice.ts` (each states its lockdown, attempts, freshness, and clearing rules in one place; `bounded-choice.ts` also owns `resolveCallerTurnId`), plus `guard-latch.ts` (the host guard latch over that same identity)
  - `controls/` — the library-owned model-facing actions (`abort.ts`, `request-handoff.ts`, `bounded-choice.ts`, `deflect-aside.ts`) in an ordered `registry.ts`
  - `handoff/` — `contract.ts` (action + signals + `HandoffSpec`), `node.ts` (`createHandoffNode` — the frozen channel contract), `delegate-client.ts` (SSE/Platform-API transport)
- `src/agent-step/paginate.ts` — the read-pagination primitives + the `pageable` orchestration the runner uses (self / delegate, the cache, the envelope)
- `src/agent-step/capture.ts` — the caller-digit capture primitives (refinement-not-regex, count-free messages, group join, candidate arrays; see `<caller_digit_capture>`)
- `src/agent-step/messages.ts` — the runner's overridable system `summary` strings: `SystemMessages`, `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`, `resolveSystemMessages`
- `src/agent-step/runner.test.ts` + `paginate.test.ts` + `capture.test.ts` + `handoff.test.ts` + `bounded-choice.test.ts` + `hardening.test.ts` + `guard-latch.test.ts` + `deflect-aside.test.ts` + `zod-state.test.ts` — worked examples covering every runner branch, the pagination primitives, the digit-capture primitives, the handoff machinery, the bounded-choice policy, the hardening guards, the turn-scoped guard latch, and the aside-deflection control; all pass on `npm test`
