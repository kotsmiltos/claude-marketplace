# Reference: agent-step Library API

<overview>
This is the runner contract the new tool consumes. The library lives at `src/agent-step/` and is **treated as immutable**: never modify it; only call `buildAgentStepTool({...})` with the right shape. The summary below is the canonical contract — match it exactly. The ground truth is in `src/agent-step/types.ts` (authoring contracts) + `src/agent-step/index.ts` (the public surface); if this doc disagrees with those, the source wins.

Since 2.0.0 the library is laid out as phase modules — `compile/` (validate → normalize → model-facing schema/description/contract composers), `run/` (admission → planning → execution → finalize), `interaction/` (one policy module per gate kind), `controls/` (the library-owned model-facing actions), `handoff/` (contract + graph node + delegate transport). **Hosts import ONLY from `src/agent-step/index.js`** — the module layout is internal and free to move; everything a tool consumes is re-exported at the index.

Since 3.0.0 the authoring model is **declarative**: every executor outcome is a declared verdict row (`ActionDef.verdicts`), executors return the row's code plus dynamic data (`DeclaredExecutorResult`), and the engine composes the wire body, the action descriptions, the gate reply contracts, and the protocol prompt fragment from the declarations. The model-facing English the engine composes is measured surface — hosts pin it in goldens; a library upgrade that moves a composed byte owes a re-measurement.

<runner_signature>
```ts
import { buildAgentStepTool } from "../../agent-step/index.js";

export const myTool = buildAgentStepTool({
  config: myConfig,                // AgentStepConfig<ActionName, PrereqName, State>
  stateSchema: AgentStateSchema,   // StateSchemaLike — the host's graph state schema
  selectors,                       // SelectorRegistry<T, ActionName> — one per action
  executors,                       // ExecutorRegistry<T, typeof selectors>
  verifiers,                       // VerifierRegistry<T>
  handoff: handoffSpec,            // OPTIONAL — opt into the built-in request_handoff (see <handoff>)
  ladders: { ... },                // OPTIONAL (3.0.0) — engine-owned escalation ladders behind the
                                   // note_refusal control; also the escalation target for
                                   // captureBounces. Requires `handoff` (see <ladders>)
  abortPolicy: { ... },            // OPTIONAL (2.5.0) — narrow the built-in abort control to an
                                   // engine-enforced in-domain transition; omit for the legacy
                                   // permissive behaviour (see <conventions> §3)
  getCallerTurnId: (state) => id,  // OPTIONAL — stable caller-turn identity resolver (see <caller_turn_identity>)
  messages: { ... },               // OPTIONAL — override the runner's own system summary strings (see <system_messages>)
  backendFailureCodes: [...],      // OPTIONAL — extra failure codes for the auto-handoff counter;
                                   // rows with `backendFailure: true` are derived automatically (see <auto_handoff>)
});
```

`stateSchema` is **required**: `StateSchemaLike = LangGraphAnnotationLike | z.ZodObject` — it accepts **either** a LangGraph `Annotation.Root` **or** a Zod object schema whose fields carry reducer/default metadata via `withLangGraph` (`@langchain/langgraph/zod`). Both resolve to the same channel classes (`BinaryOperatorAggregate` / `LastValue`), so the runner derives the intra-batch merger uniformly. The bootstrap scaffold defines graph state **once** as a Zod schema (`AgentStateSchema` in `state.ts`) and passes it here — a single source of truth for reducers AND invoke validation, no Annotation/Zod drift.

`selectors` and `executors` are both **keyed 1:1 by the exact action name** (snake_case). Build `selectors` with `satisfies SelectorRegistry<State, ActionName>` (not a type annotation) so each selector's precise return type is preserved into `typeof selectors`; `executors` is then `ExecutorRegistry<State, typeof selectors>`, which types each executor's `state` param from its selector's return — a mismatch is a compile error here, at the construction boundary. See `<conventions>` §1.

Returns a LangChain `StructuredTool` ready to register in `src/tools/index.ts`.
</runner_signature>

<types>
## AgentStepConfig

```ts
interface AgentStepConfig<ActionName extends string, PrereqName extends string, T = unknown> {
  tool: { name: string; description: string };
  actions: Record<ActionName, ActionDef<PrereqName, T>>;
}
```

`tool.name` becomes the LangChain tool name surfaced to the LLM (e.g. `"card_agent_step"`, `"accounts_agent_step"`).

`tool.description` is the lead paragraph — ONE semantic sentence; the library appends a per-action bullet list automatically, and the mechanics (batching, result shape, gate handshake) are engine-composed elsewhere (see `<composed_surface>`).

The third type param `T` is the host state — it types each row's static `stateUpdate` (`VerdictDef<T>`), so a typo'd slot fails compilation instead of silently dropping at the patch merger.

There is **no top-level `mutations` map**. All per-action behavioural opts (confirmation / OTP / match / flow lifecycle, batch-shape flags) live inline on each action under `ActionDef.controller`. Downstream-slot invalidation lives inline under `ActionDef.invalidatesOnChange`.

## ActionDef

```ts
interface ActionDef<PrereqName extends string, T = unknown> {
  description: string;             // non-empty; the SEMANTIC LEAD only — the engine composes the
                                   // final model-facing description (gate marker first, then this).
                                   // Never restate the gate handshake or enumerate verdicts here.
  summary?: string;                // optional one-line label for the tool-level action index. Add one
                                   // when the action NAME isn't self-explanatory to the model. Omit it
                                   // and the index just lists the action name alone.
  paramsSchema: z.ZodTypeAny;      // params the LLM must send
  prereqs: PrereqName[];           // state predicates checked before invoking executor
  verdicts?: Record<string, VerdictDef<T>>;
                                   // (3.0.0) declared verdict rows — the executor's RESULT SPACE.
                                   // Row keys are LOOKUP codes the executor names in its return;
                                   // an undeclared verdict fails loudly. See <declared_verdicts>.
  asks?: Record<string, DictationAsk>;
                                   // (3.0.0) standing asks keyed by verdict-or-error code — when the
                                   // batch's FINAL entry carries a listed code, the engine records the
                                   // mapped ask as the `dictation` awaiting state. See <standing_asks>.
  captureBounces?: CaptureBouncePolicy;
                                   // (3.0.0) bound consecutive `invalid_params` bounces; escalate
                                   // through a configured ladder when spent. See <ladders>.
  invalidatesOnChange?: Record<string, string[]>;
                                   // keys are slots this action may write; values are downstream
                                   // slots to reset to null when the watched slot's value CHANGES
                                   // (non-null → different value). First-time set / same-value
                                   // writes do NOT fire. See <invalidates_on_change>.
  pageable?: PageableSpec;         // opt a LIST read into uniform pagination. See <pagination>.
  controller?: ControllerHooks;    // lifecycle hooks coordinated by the runner (confirmation /
                                   // OTP / match / flow / batch-isolation). Omit for plain reads.
}
```

## VerdictDef + DeclaredExecutorResult (3.0.0) {#declared_verdicts}

<declared_verdicts>
One declared row per verdict code. The row is the ONE authority for the five things that used to be
hand-kept consistent across executors, shared constants, and wiring lists (and measurably forked):
the batch-continuation flag, the summary, the model-facing doctrine, the static state write, and the
effects.

```ts
interface VerdictDef<T = unknown> {
  ok: boolean;                     // batch-continuation flag (StepResult.ok) for this verdict
  summary: string | ((state: unknown, data: Record<string, unknown>) => string);
                                   // the body `summary` — static, or a renderer over the CURRENT
                                   // state view (language-keyed catalogs; the readBack division)
                                   // plus the executor's `data` (interpolated summaries)
  body?: Record<string, unknown | ((data: Record<string, unknown>) => unknown)>;
                                   // the remaining body fields, composed IN DECLARATION ORDER after
                                   // `summary` (declaration order IS wire order — a converted action
                                   // reproduces its historical body bytes exactly). A function value
                                   // receives the executor's `data`.
  stateUpdate?: Partial<T>;        // static host-state patch for this verdict — typed against T.
                                   // The executor's dynamic stateUpdate wins on key conflicts.
  effects?: ExecutorEffect[];      // effects applied for this verdict, AHEAD of any executor-supplied
                                   // ones — e.g. the terminal handoff that must never fork from the
                                   // outcome written in stateUpdate.
  backendFailure?: boolean;        // marks this row's `body.error` code as a backend failure for the
                                   // auto-handoff counter (derives backendFailureCodes). Requires
                                   // body.error to be a STATIC string (validated at construction).
}

interface DeclaredExecutorResult<T> {
  verdict: string;                 // names the declared row (unknown → loud `executor_error`)
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;  // dynamic values the row's function fields read
  stateUpdate?: Partial<T>;        // dynamic host-slot patch (merges OVER the row's static one)
  effects?: ExecutorEffect[];      // appended AFTER the row's effects
  resultExtras?: Record<string, unknown>;
                                   // raw fields appended to the body AFTER the declared fields
                                   // (e.g. a pageable action's `items`)
}
```

**Authoring rule:** STATIC doctrine strings live on the row (one authority); only genuinely
branch-dependent values — diagnostics, a miss reason chosen at the decision site, an interpolated
label — ride the executor's `data`. Several row keys may share one wire `verdict` (via `body.verdict`)
when their summaries differ. A terminal verdict declares its `request_handoff` effect ON THE ROW, so
the handoff can never fork from the outcome `stateUpdate` writes.

The shared-module row pattern: a deterministic continuation (a step whose result space another action
owns) declares its rows on the ACTION whose result space it shares, keeping one vocabulary.

## ControllerHooks

Per-action behavioural opts coordinated by the library, declared inline as `ActionDef.controller`. Despite the "mutation" framing, it covers gating, lifecycle, and flow hooks for read-ish actions too (`request_*` issuing OTPs, `confirm_*_otp` consuming them).

```ts
interface ControllerHooks {
  // ─── Batch-shape constraints ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  soleStep?: boolean;                       // strict: refuse any batch larger than 1.
  soleOnExecute?: boolean;                  // relaxed: propose may ride as LAST step;
                                            // execute mode must be alone.
                                            // (soleStep wins if both are set.)

  // ─── Confirm-required propose/execute gate ─────────────────────────────────
  requiresConfirmation?: boolean | ConfirmationOpts;

  // ─── SCA / OTP gating ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  requiresOtp?: boolean;                    // refuse unless awaitingInput.kind="otp"
                                            // for this action; auto-clears on ok:true.
  issuesOtp?: { consumer_action: string };  // executor reports the `otp_issued` effect;
                                            // library sets awaitingInput=otp.

  // ─── Multi-turn flow lifecycle ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  startsFlow?: { name: string };            // on ok: create currentFlow (or merge if same name).
  endsFlow?: boolean;                       // on ok: clear currentFlow AND awaitingInput.
  requiresFlow?: string;                    // refuse unless currentFlow.name matches.

  // ─── Double-entry verification (PIN/password repeat) ───────────────────────
  startsMatchFor?: { consumer_action: string };
  requiresMatch?: { capturer: string; maxAttempts?: number };
}

interface ConfirmationOpts {
  maxAttempts?: number;            // re-propose budget before the gate exhausts. Default 3.
  lockdown?: boolean;              // default true — refuses unrelated batches while pending.
  readBack?: (params: Record<string, unknown>, state: unknown) => string | undefined;
                                   // (2.3.0) render what the runner ACTUALLY recorded, for the model
                                   // to speak back verbatim. Rides the proposal as `read_back`.
  readBackDirective?: (params: Record<string, unknown>, state: unknown) => string | undefined;
                                   // (3.0.0) how the model must FRAME the rendered read_back — what,
                                   // if anything, may precede or follow the verbatim bytes ("this is
                                   // the capture: append one short confirm question"; "this recap is
                                   // complete: add nothing"). Called only when readBack rendered
                                   // non-empty; a non-empty return rides the proposal as
                                   // `read_back_directive`. Model-facing English, never caller-audible.
  repeatReadBack?: boolean;        // (2.5.0) persist the readBack rendering on the gate and inject the
                                   // sole-step `repeat_pending_question` control, which returns those
                                   // EXACT stored bytes on a later caller turn. Default false.
                                   // (3.0.0) REQUIRES replyContract — validated at construction: a
                                   // repeatable gate routes re-asks through the repeat control, which
                                   // the generic reply contract forbids ("make no call").
  replyContract?: GateContractSpec;// (3.0.0) replace the runner's generic `reply_contract` on THIS
                                   // action's proposals with an engine-COMPOSED action-specific one.
                                   // See <gate_contracts>.
  refuseProposal?: (params: Record<string, unknown>, state: unknown)
    => ({ summary: string; error: string } & Record<string, unknown>) | null | undefined;
                                   // (2.5.0) propose-time, STATE-aware refusal. Runs on the
                                   // propose/re-propose path AFTER params parse and BEFORE anything
                                   // commits: no gate stored, no attempt spent. Return a result body
                                   // to refuse; null/undefined to proceed.
}
```

**`readBack`** exists because the library owns the CAPTURE half — `capture.ts` sanitized, joined and
validated those params — so it alone knows the exact stored value. Handing the model raw
`proposed_params` and leaving "tell the caller what was recorded" to its discretion is measurably where
read-backs break. The library does NOT own the LEXICON, so the host supplies this function; it receives
the **parsed** params and the current state view (deliberately non-generic — hosts cast their own state
exactly as executors do with their slices). The protocol prompt fragment (`<composed_surface>`) carries
the READ-BACK authority rule, so no per-host prompt rule is needed any more.

**`repeatReadBack`** persists the rendering on the gate; the sole-step `repeat_pending_question` control
(reserved only when at least one action opts in) returns the stored bytes verbatim — no executor run, no
re-render from mutable state, no params/attempts change, and the gate is not consumed. Repetition
advances the gate's presentation-turn provenance — the repeated recap becomes the question the caller
must answer on a LATER turn.

**`refuseProposal`** fills the lifecycle gap between the params schema (shape, no state access) and the
executor (state, but runs only AFTER consent): a schema-valid, state-impossible proposal is answered
immediately, storing nothing and burning nothing. Keep it a pure function of (params, state) and mirror
the executor's own consumption rule so the two can never disagree.

There is deliberately **no TTL**: the runner times nothing out. Stale gates clear via `abort_pending_input` or via backend signals the executor surfaces as `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow` effects.

The executor owns any pre-read and post-read; the library enforces the gates above plus the propose-then-execute handshake (see `<confirmation_lifecycle>`).

## GateContractSpec (3.0.0) {#gate_contracts}

<gate_contracts>
The declarative form of `ConfirmationOpts.replyContract`. The reply contract riding a proposal is the
COMPLETE classification of the caller's next reply while the gate pends; for mutations whose gate
outranks the generic yes/correction taxonomy (a permanent closure seeing third-party speech,
re-selection, clarification-with-repeat), the host declares only what the engine cannot know, and
`composeGateContract` (exported) writes the frame clauses the engine enforces — the lead, the
exact-params yes clause (sole-step when the action declares `soleOnExecute`), and the closing
never-re-call guard — AROUND the host's categories. Composed at construction; the action name and
sole-step rule come from the action itself (`GateContractContext`), never the spec, so the contract
cannot fork from the gate it governs.

```ts
interface GateContractSpec {
  subject: string;         // the pending question as the lead clause names it
                           // (e.g. "this permanent-closure consent question")
  subjectNoun: string;     // its short noun phrase, cited by the yes clause and the closing guard
                           // (e.g. "consent question")
  executesLabel: string;   // what the execute re-call performs (e.g. "the permanent closure")
  categories: readonly string[];
                           // the host's measured reply categories, joined verbatim in order between
                           // the yes clause and the closing guard. Complete sentences, host bytes.
}
```

Empty/omitted keeps the runner's generic template (`SystemMessages.confirm_reply_contract`). A
non-empty spec is the SOLE authority for that action — the generic template is not concatenated, so
declare every reply class you want handled, including the generic yes/correction ones (the frame's yes
clause covers the yes).

## Verifier

```ts
interface Verifier<T> {
  check: (state: T) => boolean;
  denial: { summary: string; error: string };
}
```

Self-contained: the predicate AND the denial body live together in one file. The denial body is what appears in the result envelope when the prereq fails.

The `check` predicate is a snapshot of **journey progress** — "is the user identified?", "is an entity selected?" — not a record of step ordering. Gate on *where the user is*, never on *what ran first*. The companion mechanism for keeping that progress coherent when an upstream slot changes is `invalidatesOnChange` (see `<invalidates_on_change>` below).

## ExecutorEffect

```ts
type ExecutorEffect =
  | { type: "request_handoff"; request: HandoffRequest }
                                   // terminal business outcome: atomically clears every transient
                                   // runner slot (awaitingInput, currentFlow, pagedRead) and writes
                                   // the `handoff` slot — exactly like the built-in request_handoff
                                   // action. Honoured regardless of `ok` (a refusal verdict may still
                                   // be terminal). TERMINAL IS ENFORCED: once the handoff is set, the
                                   // step's remaining interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch
                                   // ends after the current step (handoff monotonicity). The ONLY way
                                   // an executor (or verdict row) requests a handoff. Declare it on
                                   // the terminal verdict's ROW so it can never fork from the outcome.
  | { type: "merge_flow_data"; data: Record<string, unknown> }
                                   // shallow-merge into currentFlow.data. Honoured on ok:true;
                                   // requesting it with no active flow (and no startsFlow on the
                                   // action) is a programmer mistake and throws.
  | { type: "otp_issued" }         // this step minted an SCA challenge; the runner opens the OTP
                                   // gate for the consumer named in the action's issuesOtp hook.
  | { type: "clear_awaiting_input" }
                                   // drop the pending input gate only, keep the flow (e.g. OTP timeout).
  | { type: "abort_flow" };        // terminal in-flow failure; drop the gate AND the flow.
```

Effects are **signals, not an ordered program** — the runner honours each one at a fixed, documented point of the step lifecycle (see `<state_threading>` step 5f). Row effects apply ahead of executor effects.

## Selector / SelectorRegistry

```ts
// Projects the host state T down to the slice ONE action's executor needs.
// Trusted glue: may reshape/rename, not just narrow. Looked up by action name.
type Selector<T> = (state: T) => unknown;

// Selectors keyed 1:1 by action name (the key IS the action name).
type SelectorRegistry<T, ActionName extends string> = Record<ActionName, Selector<T>>;
```

The runner runs `selectors[action](view)` and hands the result to the executor as its `state`. The executor never sees the whole state — only what its selector returned. Keep selectors pure (no I/O).

## Executor / ExecutorRegistry

```ts
// Receives `Slice` — whatever the action's selector returned — NOT the whole
// state. Returns a DeclaredExecutorResult<T> naming a declared verdict row;
// its stateUpdate may patch any HOST-OWNED slot (the reducers merge them);
// library-managed slots are rejected loudly — request those transitions via
// `effects` (usually on the row).
type Executor<Slice, T> = (params: unknown, state: Slice) => Promise<DeclaredExecutorResult<T>>;

// Keyed 1:1 by action name. Each entry's `state` param is derived from that
// action's selector return (ReturnType<Selectors[K]>), so an executor whose
// signature doesn't match what its selector produces is a compile error.
type ExecutorRegistry<T, Selectors extends Record<string, Selector<T>>> = {
  [K in keyof Selectors]: Executor<ReturnType<Selectors[K]>, T>;
};
```

(The pre-3.0 `ExecutorResult` return shape — `{ resultBody, ok, stateUpdate?, effects? }` — was
**removed from the public contract** in 3.0.0: rows ARE the result space. The type survives only as the
runner's internal normalization target and is no longer exported.)

## AwaitingInput (library-managed)

The runner's cursor for "what input does the customer owe right now". Discriminated union over the four kinds — three locking GATES plus one non-locking ASK:

```ts
type AwaitingInput =
  | { kind: "dictation";    for_action: string; param: string;
      expects: "digits" | "text"; flow_ref?: string }
                                              // (3.0.0) the STANDING ASK — a verdict asked the caller
                                              // for a fresh value (ActionDef.asks). A record, not a
                                              // gate: it does NOT lock the surface. See <standing_asks>.
  | { kind: "confirmation"; for_action: string; params: object;
      attempts_left: number; max_attempts: number; flow_ref?: string;
      proposed_on_caller_turn_id?: string;    // the caller turn the proposal was stored on (or last
                                              // REPEATED on — the repeat control advances it); a
                                              // matching re-call on the SAME turn is refused.
      read_back?: string }                    // exact caller-audible rendering, persisted only when the
                                              // owning action sets repeatReadBack;
                                              // repeat_pending_question returns these stored bytes.
  | { kind: "otp";          for_action: string; flow_ref: string }
  | { kind: "match";        for_action: string;
      attempts_left: number; max_attempts: number; flow_ref?: string };
```

Lockdown semantics for the three GATES (first step of the next batch must satisfy this):

| kind | allowed first step | else |
|------|-------------------|------|
| `confirmation` | `for_action` (resolves to execute/re-propose/exhausted) or `abort_pending_input` | `pending_confirmation_locked` |
| `otp` | `for_action`, a **same-flow issuer** (an action whose `issuesOtp.consumer_action` is this gate's `for_action` AND whose `requiresFlow` equals this gate's `flow_ref` — re-send replaces the gate with a fresh one), or `abort_pending_input` | `otp_pending_locked` |
| `match` | `for_action`, the **capturer** (re-capture resets), or `abort_pending_input` | `match_pending_locked` |

A `dictation` never locks anything — the caller may pivot; the record exists so results can tell the model what is owed. The library does NOT TTL any slot. Stale gates clear via `abort_pending_input` or via backend signals (surfaced by the executor as `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow` effects).

## CurrentFlow (library-managed)

Single active flow at a time (flow mutex). Set on `startsFlow` ok; cleared on `endsFlow` ok or an `abort_flow` effect:

```ts
interface CurrentFlow {
  name: string;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;   // scratch bag; executors merge via the merge_flow_data effect
}
```

Starting a different flow while another is active fails with `error: "flow_already_active"`. Re-entering the SAME flow is idempotent — the executor runs (e.g. to re-issue an OTP), and its `merge_flow_data` effect shallow-merges into the existing `currentFlow.data` (no reset).

## spentLadders (library-managed) — 3.0.0

Per-ladder free-use counts: `Record<string, number> | null`, ladder name → uses so far. Carries every
once-latch — the configured `note_refusal` ladders AND the per-action capture-bounce counters (under
the reserved key shape `"capture:<action>"`). When a ladder's count reaches its configured
`maxFreeUses` (or a capture policy's `max`), the next use escalates atomically into the configured
handoff. Task-scoped: a task-ending handback clears it; an `off_topic` roundtrip does not — a spent
explanation stays spent when the same task resumes. The runner is the only writer.

## PagedCache (library-managed)

The reslice-cache for `pageable` reads (self mode). On a cache miss the runner stores the full result set + the query signature; on a same-query re-page it serves the page from here WITHOUT re-running the executor. One active set at a time; untouched unless an action declares `pageable`.

```ts
interface PagedCache<Row> {
  key: string;                       // the action name that produced the set
  signature: string;                 // params signature (excludes page/pageSize)
  rows: Row[];                       // the FULL set
  extras: Record<string, unknown>;   // the executor's non-`items` result fields, replayed per page
}
```

The host gets the six library slots (`awaitingInput` / `currentFlow` / `pagedRead` / `spentLadders` / `handoff` / `errorCount`) by spreading the library's `agentStepZodShape` into its Zod state schema — the bootstrap state template does this. Each slot is wrapped with `withLangGraph` so it carries the runner's expected last-writer-wins reducer/default as channel metadata. The per-slot schemas (`AwaitingInputSchema`, `CurrentFlowSchema`, `PagedCacheSchema`, `HandoffRequestSchema`) are individually exported from `index.ts` too. (A host still on a LangGraph `Annotation.Root` spreads the equivalent `agentStepStateSpec` fragment instead.) `buildAgentStepTool` **verifies channel completeness at construction**: a state schema missing a channel for any library slot the configuration writes throws (the message names the missing slots and the spreadable fragments).

Since 3.0.0 the slot metadata lives in ONE table — **`AGENT_STEP_SLOT_META`** (exported) — from which
the derived views are computed and key-locked at compile time:

- **`agentStepTaskScopedSlots`** — the subset describing work IN PROGRESS (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `pagedRead`, `spentLadders`, `errorCount`), which `createHandoffNode` nulls when a task-ENDING handback resolves. `handoff` is deliberately absent: the node returns it as null either way.
- **`agentStepRunnerOwnedSlots`** — the slots an executor `stateUpdate` may not write (currently all six; the flag exists because history proved the exception class).
- **`agentStepInternalSlotMask`** — a Zod `.omit()` mask of the six library-managed slot keys. A host derives a graph INPUT schema by omitting these (runner-written only, never caller input): `AgentStateSchema.omit({ ...agentStepInternalSlotMask, /* + host-derived slots */ }).partial().extend({ messages: MessagesZodState.shape.messages })`. Re-attach `messages` after `.partial()` — `.partial()` strips the messages-channel metadata LangGraph Studio keys off to render its chat input box (see `state-and-prompt-integration.md`).

## HandoffRequest (library-managed)

The pending channel-handoff request, written by the built-in `request_handoff` action (only available when the tool opted in via `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff`), by a `request_handoff` **effect** (on a verdict row or an executor return), or by the engine itself (ladder exhaustion, auto-handoff) — never through `stateUpdate`, which throws. Resolved — then cleared — by the host graph's `createHandoffNode(spec)` node. `null` otherwise; rides `agentStepZodShape` like the other slots. Once set, handoff is **monotonic**: the step's remaining interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch ends after the current step. See `<handoff>`.

```ts
interface HandoffRequest {
  reason: "off_topic" | "completed" | "abandon";
  context: string;  // per-reason, never empty, always in the customer's language:
                    // off_topic → the customer's request (verbatim or tightly summarized);
                    // completed / abandon → the closing line the node speaks
}
```

## errorCount (library-managed)

The consecutive backend-failure counter for the auto-handoff guard (`<auto_handoff>`). `number | null`; rides `agentStepZodShape` like the other slots. The runner increments it when a batch ends in a backend failure, resets it to 0 when a batch in which an executor **actually ran** ends without one, and clears it to 0 when it auto-triggers a handoff at the threshold. Batches where no executor ran (confirm-gate proposals/re-proposals, prereq or param refusals, aborts, handoff signals) are **neutral** — they neither increment nor reset. Executors must never write it.

</types>

<composed_surface>
## The engine-composed model surface (3.0.0)

Three composers turn the declarations into the model-facing English, so no host hand-rolls (and forks)
the machinery text. All three are **measured surface**: hosts pin the output in a model-surface golden,
and an upstream change to composed bytes owes a live re-measurement.

**Action descriptions** (`compile/action-describe.ts`, applied automatically): each schema variant's
`.describe()` bytes are `<gate marker> <host semantic lead>` — the marker (derived from the controller:
gate presence, `read_back` presence, the sole-on-execute rule, the invalid_params recoverability note)
comes FIRST, then `ActionDef.description` verbatim. There is deliberately NO verdict index — a result
that explains itself does not need a preview in the schema (the enumerated index was measured as 34% of
the domain-action bytes while duplicating what results already carry). Hosts therefore write
descriptions as the semantic lead ONLY.

**Gate reply contracts** (`compile/gate-contract.ts`): see `<gate_contracts>` above. Composed at
construction from `ConfirmationOpts.replyContract`; rides proposals as `reply_contract`.

**The protocol prompt fragment** (`compile/protocol.ts`, exported as `composeProtocolPrompt`): the
system-prompt text that interprets the engine's own machinery — tool-turn vs speaking-turn, the
reply/ask contracts, the gate handshake, READ-BACK authority, handoff silence — composed from the
host's feature surface. Hosts splice it into their system prompt via a placeholder and write NONE of
it themselves:

```ts
const PROTOCOL_FRAGMENT = composeProtocolPrompt({
  config: myConfig,               // tool name + actions (asks/gate presence read from it)
  ladders: myLadders,             // omit if none
  handoff: handoffSpec,           // omit if none
  toolTurnRules: [ /* host DOMAIN tool-turn clauses — e.g. the digit-capture hard rule.
                      Spliced as the FIRST lettered clauses of the TOOL TURN bullet — the
                      measured position; detached placement measured 0/4. */ ],
});
// prompt template carries "{PROTOCOL}"; splice PROTOCOL_FRAGMENT there.
```

`ProtocolSurface` is deliberately narrow (config + registries + handoff presence) so an env-free prompt
module can call it with exactly what it already exports. Sentence ownership is exclusive (one
authority): the tool DESCRIPTION keeps its per-action/control one-liners, RESULT BODIES keep the
per-turn contracts/directives/asks, and the fragment keeps the turn/speech protocol.
</composed_surface>

<standing_asks>
## Standing asks / dictation (3.0.0)

The plainest input kind — "the customer owes a fresh value" — declared per verdict via
`ActionDef.asks`, applied by the batch finalizer, and made visible to the model on the final entry.
Unlike the three gates it does NOT lock the surface: it is the engine's record of the standing
question; capturing the answer remains the MODEL's job (deterministic caller-turn interception was
built, measured live, and removed — the engine must never fabricate assistant turns).

```ts
interface DictationAsk {
  action: string;                  // target action the customer's value feeds (must exist)
  param: string;                   // the target's param carrying the capture (must be declared on it)
  expects: "digits" | "text";      // what was asked for (descriptive; kind-specific behavior keys on it)
  render?: (state: unknown) => string | undefined;
                                   // render the caller-audible ask ITSELF (language/lexicon live in
                                   // state — the readBack division). A non-empty return rides the
                                   // final entry as `ask_text`, and the ask contract directs the model
                                   // to speak it EXACTLY — engine-rendered bytes are how fixed
                                   // sentences stay verbatim (a model reciting a catalog line from
                                   // prompt memory measurably decorates it; measured 2/8 prompt-side
                                   // vs 8/8 on the wire). Omit for asks whose wording the model may own.
}
```

Lifecycle — the batch's FINAL entry decides (`ok:false` short-circuits, so the last entry is exactly
what the model relays):

- Final entry's verdict-or-error code is listed in the acting action's `asks` → the mapped ask becomes
  `awaitingInput = { kind: "dictation", for_action, param, expects }`, and the entry is stamped with
  `standing_ask: { action, param }`, `ask_contract` (the `standing_ask_contract` system message), and
  `ask_text` when `render` returned bytes.
- Final entry from the SAME action with an unlisted code → a dictation standing for that action was
  serviced; it clears. A dictation for a DIFFERENT action stands (the caller still owes the value).
- A live GATE always outranks an ask: a confirmation/OTP/match set or left standing by the batch IS
  the standing question; asks never stomp it. Skipped entirely on a handoff.

Keys are verdict-or-error codes as the wire carries them (`resultBody.verdict`, else the entry's
`error`) — runner-raised codes like `invalid_params` are legal keys, which is how "every recoverable
digit miss re-asks digits for this action" is declared once.
</standing_asks>

<ladders>
## Escalation ladders + note_refusal + captureBounces (3.0.0)

Engine-owned "once" counters. The prompt's once-rules — explain a refusal once, deflect an aside once,
suggest the lookup once — used to make the model count from conversation history; they become
configured ladders whose state lives in the task-scoped `spentLadders` latch. The model keeps only the
semantic classification; the engine owns first-versus-repeat.

```ts
// BuildAgentStepToolOptions.ladders: LadderRegistry — requires `handoff`.
type LadderRegistry = Record<string, EscalationLadder>;

interface EscalationLadder {
  description: string;             // one-line semantic condition, shown in the control's schema index
  instruction: string;             // model-facing instruction returned on a FREE use (rides the
                                   // result as its summary — e.g. "decline in ONE short sentence and
                                   // re-ask your pending question in the SAME turn")
  onExhaust: HandoffRequest;       // the handoff applied ATOMICALLY when the free uses are spent.
                                   // Validated against the LIBRARY schema, not the host's
                                   // modelRequestSchema — an escalation route is engine-only by
                                   // design (remove it from the model-requestable routes and the
                                   // engine holds the only path to it).
  maxFreeUses?: number;            // free in-place uses before escalation. Default 1.
}
```

A non-empty registry injects the sole-step **`note_refusal`** control (`NOTE_REFUSAL_ACTION`; the name
becomes reserved). Params: `{ ladder: <configured name> }` (a Zod enum over the registry). The control:

- **Free use:** counts the latch (`spentLadders[name]++`), touches nothing else — every pending
  gate/flow survives — and returns the ladder's `instruction` as the summary (`refusal_noted: true`).
  The standing ask/gate the caller stepped away from is exactly what the model must return to.
- **Uses spent:** escalates ATOMICALLY into `onExhaust` (the same slot transition `request_handoff`
  performs) — no window where the model must issue a second call, and no model-selectable route. The
  result carries `ladder_exhausted: true, handoff_requested: true`.
- A refusal while a gate/choice pends is classified by THAT interaction's reply contract, never by the
  ladder (`allowedDuringGateLockdown: false`).

The host prompt teaches only the semantic classification (declined/unavailable vs a question your
instructions answer vs a cancellation); the control's composed description carries the ladder index.

**`ActionDef.captureBounces`** rides the same latch: `{ max, ladder }` counts CONSECUTIVE
`invalid_params` bounces of that action under `spentLadders["capture:<action>"]`, cleared by any parse
that succeeds; when the count reaches `max`, the bounce escalates through the named ladder (which must
exist in the registry — validated at construction). `max: 2` is the measured knob — the model
improvises past ~3 identical bounces, and the escalation must fire before that.
</ladders>

<conventions>
## 1. Selector + executor keyed by the exact action name

Selectors and executors are registered **1:1 under the exact action name** (snake_case). There is NO name transformation — the registry key IS the action name.

```ts
const selectors = {
  verify_customer: verifyCustomerSlice,   // getSlice from actions/verify_customer/stateSelector.ts
  list_accounts:   listAccountsSlice,
} satisfies SelectorRegistry<State, ActionName>;

const executors: ExecutorRegistry<State, typeof selectors> = {
  verify_customer: verifyCustomer,        // the function name is free; the KEY is the action name
  list_accounts:   listAccounts,
};
```

The runner throws at construction if either registry is missing an action's entry:

```
agent-step: action "verify_customer" expects a state selector at selectors["verify_customer"] but none was found.
agent-step: action "verify_customer" expects an executor at executors["verify_customer"] but none was found.
```

## 2. Verifier name = prereq name

A prereq name in `ActionDef.prereqs` (e.g. `"customerVerified"`) is the same key used in the `verifiers` registry. Runner throws:

```
agent-step: action "verify_card" lists prereq "customerVerified" but verifiers["customerVerified"] was not provided.
```

## 3. Reserved action names

`abort_pending_input` is ALWAYS reserved — the library auto-injects it into the tool schema whenever ANY action declares one of: `requiresConfirmation`, `requiresOtp`, `issuesOtp`, `startsFlow`, `endsFlow`, `requiresFlow`, `requiresMatch`, `startsMatchFor`. `request_handoff` is reserved ONLY when `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff` is provided (see `<handoff>`) — a tool that does NOT opt in may define its own action under that name (the orchestrator/scaffold handoff mechanism does exactly that). `note_refusal` (3.0.0) is reserved ONLY when `ladders` is non-empty (see `<ladders>`) — sole-step (`note_refusal_must_be_sole_step`: the turn answers a refusal, not a value; on the exhausted path the step escalates into a handoff, which abandons the turn). `repeat_pending_question` (renamed from `repeat_pending_confirmation` in 3.0.0) is reserved ONLY when at least one action sets `ConfirmationOpts.repeatReadBack` — sole-step (`repeat_confirmation_must_be_sole_step`: a recap is a read-only turn boundary; domain work in the same batch could turn the caller's clarification into consent; the group name keeps the historical "confirmation" vocabulary deliberately — byte-pinned engine codes). These library-owned actions are **controls** (`controls/` in the library): each carries its own activation, schema variant, description line, lockdown allowances, and execution — the run pipeline dispatches them instead of an executor. Declaring a reserved name throws:

```
agent-step: "<name>" is a reserved action name auto-injected by the library; remove it from config.actions.
```

`abort_pending_input` is idempotent — it clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow` together. No-op when nothing is active.

**`abortPolicy`** (2.5.0, optional) narrows abort from that permissive default into an engine-enforced
in-domain transition. Omit it and the legacy behaviour is preserved byte-for-byte. When configured:

```ts
interface AbortPolicy<ActionName extends string> {
  requireActive?: boolean;                      // refuse abort when no gate or flow is active.
                                                // Default false.
  allowStandalone?: boolean;                    // permit abort as the batch's only step; when false,
                                                // exactly one legal follower is required. Default true.
  allowedFollowers?: readonly ActionName[];     // domain actions that may immediately follow abort.
                                                // Omit = any declared domain action; [] = none.
  allowedPendingTargets?: readonly ActionName[];// gates abort may clear: batch-start awaitingInput
                                                // must exist and its for_action be listed. Omit = any.
}
```

Admission then enforces: abort LEADS the batch, clears something real when `requireActive`, and has at
most one declared domain follower — control followers are never legal. Every knob is validated at
construction (unknown or duplicate action names, an unsatisfiable `allowStandalone=false` with an empty
follower list — all throw). The activation renders the configured contract into the control's own
model-facing description, so the surface the model reads is derived from the same configuration the
engine enforces.

## 4. Per-action description is required — and is the semantic lead ONLY

A non-empty `description` string is required on every action (empty/missing throws). Since 3.0.0 the
engine composes the final model-facing description (`<composed_surface>`): write the business
semantics, the param meanings, and what `ok` changes; never the gate handshake or a verdict
enumeration — those bytes are engine-owned and restating them duplicates them on the wire.

## 5. Controller hooks live on the action

Lifecycle opts are declared inline as `ActionDef.controller`, so there is no separate map that can drift from `actions`. A controller-referenced peer action (e.g. an `issuesOtp.consumer_action` or a `requiresMatch.capturer`) must still name a real action, or the corresponding check throws (see `<construction_time_checks>`).

## 6. Tool layout: declaration beside executor

Row-based actions declare beside their executors — `src/tools/<name>/actions/<action>/action.ts`
(schema + description + rows + asks + controller), with `config.ts` a slim assembler and `names.ts` a
types-only leaf (`ActionName`/`PrereqName`) so the declaration ↔ config import graph stays acyclic.
See `tool-directory-layout.md`.

<state_threading>
## How state flows through a batch

When the LLM calls the tool with `[step1, step2, step3]`:

1. Runner reads the FULL state via `getCurrentTaskInput<T>()` — this is the snapshot at batch start (NOT a live view, important for same-batch-bypass safety).
2. Merger is built from the state schema passed as `stateSchema` (a Zod object whose fields carry reducer metadata via `withLangGraph`, OR a LangGraph `Annotation.Root`). Each field's reducer is extracted from its channel's `BinaryOperatorAggregate.operator`; a Zod schema's channels are resolved through the langgraph zod registry to the same channel classes. The `messages` field is explicitly skipped (the runner emits its own `ToolMessage` at the end). When any confirm gate is configured, the runner also resolves the **caller-turn identity** here (`getCallerTurnId`, defaulting to the latest human message id — see `<caller_turn_identity>`).
3. **Admission** (`run/admission.ts`) — every whole-batch precondition, in a FIXED order, each able to refuse the batch (a single result entry, `failed_at: 0`, nothing committed):
   a. **Unknown action** — hallucinated/typo'd names get a structured refusal.
   b. **Gate lockdown** — a pending confirmation/OTP/match admits only its target action / abort / handoff / the repeat control (+ the capturer, for match; + a same-flow issuer, for otp; see lockdown table above).
   c. **Flow mutex** — first step `startsFlow=X` while `currentFlow.name=Y` (≠X) → refuse `flow_already_active`.
   d. **Control exclusivity** — sole-step control families (handoff, repeat, ladder), in registry-group order.
   e. **Abort policy** — the optional host source/follower allow-lists.
   f. **soleStep / soleOnExecute** — per-action batch-shape refusal (computed off batch-start pending so the LLM-natural `[verify, mutate]` batch can propose).
4. **Plan expansion** (`run/planning.ts`) — tag each user step with its confirmation mode (`propose` | `rePropose` | `execute` | `sameTurnLocked` | `exhausted`) based on pending state at batch-start. Frozen before any executor runs (same-batch-bypass safety). Planning is **abort-aware**: confirm steps AFTER an `abort_pending_input` in the same batch plan against NO pending — they propose fresh instead of executing against the gate the batch just cleared.
5. For each planned step (`run/execution.ts`):
   a. Control steps (`abort_pending_input`, `request_handoff`, `repeat_pending_question`, `note_refusal`) dispatch to their `ControlAction` implementation, not an executor.
   b. Library-managed prereqs (`requiresFlow`, then `requiresOtp` / `requiresMatch`) → refuse if not gated.
   c. User-declared prereqs (verifiers) → refuse with denial body.
   d. Validate params via `paramsSchema.parse` — an `invalid_params` bounce also feeds the action's `captureBounces` counter when declared (escalating through the named ladder when spent).
   e. Run the action's selector against the running `view` to build the slice, then call the executor: `executors[action](params, selectors[action](view))`. The declared return is normalized through the named verdict row (summary rendered over the current view; body composed in declaration order; `resultExtras` appended; row stateUpdate/effects merged UNDER the executor's). An undeclared verdict — or a thrown executor — is caught, marked `ok:false` (`error: "executor_error"`), and short-circuits; earlier steps' commits are preserved.
   f. Apply the outputs in this order: `stateUpdate` (host slots only — library slots throw) → `request_handoff` effect (terminal; skips the rest) → `startsFlow` + `merge_flow_data` → auto-clear of `requiresOtp`/`requiresMatch` on ok → `otp_issued` → `startsMatchFor` → `endsFlow` → `clear_awaiting_input` / `abort_flow`. (Consume BEFORE issue: one action may both consume a match and issue an OTP, and `awaitingInput` is a single replace-on-write slot — issuing first would have the consume wipe the freshly opened gate.) On ok:false + `verdict:"match_mismatch"`, decrement match attempts (or abort flow on exhaustion). **Handoff monotonicity:** once the `handoff` slot is set (control, row effect, or executor effect), the remaining interaction lifecycle is skipped and the batch ends after the current step, whatever `ok` was.
6. **Finalize** (`run/finalize.ts`) — build the result body, apply the **standing-ask lifecycle** (the final entry sets/clears the `dictation` record and is stamped `standing_ask` / `ask_text` / `ask_contract` — see `<standing_asks>`), apply the error-counter/auto-handoff policy, and emit a single `ToolMessage` whose content is the JSON-stringified `RunnerResultBody = { summary, results, failed_at? }`.

**Cumulative commit on partial failure:** state patches from successful earlier steps DO commit even if a later step fails. Example: `[verify_customer (ok), verify_card (fail)]` → `verifiedCustomer` persists for the next turn.

**Crucial:** state slots in the graph's `state.ts` MUST declare an explicit reducer. The library reads the reducer at runtime. Slots declared without a reducer get replace-on-write behavior (which is fine — but be explicit about it).
</state_threading>

<confirmation_lifecycle>
## Mutation propose → execute lifecycle (when `requiresConfirmation` is set)

The runner switches the mutation action into a five-mode state machine. Detected by reading `awaitingInput.kind === "confirmation"`:

**Ordering with prereqs (non-obvious, but guaranteed).** A step's library prereqs (`requiresFlow`) and user verifiers run BEFORE its confirmation mode is acted on (`<state_threading>` step 5b/5c, ahead of the propose in 5f). So a confirm-gated mutation whose `requiresFlow`/prereqs are unmet is **refused, not proposed** — `awaitingInput` is never set into a doomed state. Compose `requiresConfirmation` with `requiresFlow` freely; the gate order is correct.

### First call (no pending, or pending action ≠ this action) → **propose mode**
- Parse params with the action's **effective schema** (the declared `paramsSchema`, page-extended for `pageable` actions) and store them **PARSED** — schema normalization (`z.preprocess`, coercion) is applied before storage: `awaitingInput = { kind: "confirmation", for_action, params, attempts_left: maxAttempts, max_attempts, proposed_on_caller_turn_id? }`. The proposal is stamped with the current caller-turn identity when one exists (see `<caller_turn_identity>`).
- A failed parse returns `{ ok: false, error: "invalid_params" }` with the overridable `invalid_params` system-message summary and the raw Zod detail in `_debug` (nothing is stored; the action's `captureBounces` counter, when declared, counts the bounce).
- Return `{ ok: true, summary, needs_confirmation: true, proposed_params, attempts_left }`, plus:
  - **`read_back`** when the action declares `ConfirmationOpts.readBack` and it renders non-empty for these parsed params. Absent — not empty — when it renders nothing.
  - **`read_back_directive`** when `readBackDirective` renders non-empty (how to frame the bytes).
  - **`reply_contract`** — the complete classification of the caller's next reply: the composed action-specific contract when the action declares `replyContract`, else the generic `confirm_reply_contract` template. The gate turn reacts to THIS, not prompt memory.
- **Executor is NOT invoked.**

### Re-call whose params **parse to the pending proposal**, on a LATER caller turn → **execute mode**
- The incoming RAW params are parsed with the same effective schema, then compared (deep value equality) against the stored parsed proposal — value normalization never reads as drift (e.g. a `z.preprocess` stripping STT separators: `"70,76"` ≡ `"7076"`). A failed parse counts as drift (→ rePropose).
- Clear `awaitingInput` atomically BEFORE invoking the executor.
- Invoke the executor with the parsed params + view.
- The executor's named verdict row composes the result (the executor performs its own pre-read + write + post-read).

### Matching re-call on the SAME caller turn → **sameTurnLocked** (2.0.0)
- The proposal carries `proposed_on_caller_turn_id`; a matching re-call while that turn is still current means the caller has NOT actually answered the read-back — the model is confirming with itself. Refused with `error: "confirmation_same_turn_locked"`: no attempt is spent, the gate stays untouched, and execution requires a re-call on a later caller turn.
- Enforced only when both turn identities exist. Identity-less direct `runSteps` consumers (state fixtures without message ids) keep the params-only behavior. **Test-harness implication:** manual propose → execute sequences must simulate the caller's answering turn — append a fresh human message id between the two calls (the bootstrap harness ships `answeredTurn` / `runConfirmed` helpers for exactly this).

### Re-call with **genuinely different params** (or params that fail to parse) → **rePropose mode**
- Update `awaitingInput.params` to the newly parsed params, decrement `attempts_left`.
- If the re-call's params fail to parse: the step fails with `invalid_params` (summary = the overridable system message, raw Zod detail in `_debug`) and the pending proposal is left **unchanged** — no decrement, the prior proposal still stands.
- If `attempts_left > 0`: return new `needs_confirmation` envelope with decremented `attempts_left` — including a fresh `read_back` rendered from the CORRECTED params, so the caller hears what actually replaced the old value.
- If `attempts_left === 0`: return `{ ok: false, summary, error: "confirmation_attempts_exhausted" }` and clear pending.

### The repeat control (`repeat_pending_question`)
When an action opts into `repeatReadBack`, a "pardon?" / channel-check turn has a legal move that is
neither consent nor drift: the sole-step `repeat_pending_question` control re-presents the gate's
stored `read_back` bytes (with `read_back_directive_repeat` framing) — no executor run, no re-render
from mutable state, no params/attempts change, and the gate is not consumed. It advances only the
gate's presentation-turn provenance: the repeated recap is now the question the caller must answer on
a LATER turn. Misdirected calls (no pending gate, gate not opted in, no stored rendering) fail closed
and change nothing.

### Lockdown
If `awaitingInput.kind === "confirmation"` and `lockdown: true` (default), the batch MUST start with either:
- The same action as the pending one (resolves to execute / rePropose / exhausted), OR
- `abort_pending_input` (library-handled; clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow`; abort may be the first step of a larger batch — subsequent steps run after the gate clears), OR
- an allowed control (`request_handoff`, `repeat_pending_question`, per its own rules).

Anything else → `{ ok: false, error: "pending_confirmation_locked", awaiting: { kind, for_action } }`.

### abort_pending_input
Library auto-injects this action into the schema whenever ANY lifecycle opt is declared. It is library-handled (no executor needed):
- If `awaitingInput` or `currentFlow` is set → clear both; return `{ ok: true, summary: "Pending input and/or flow aborted.", aborted_awaiting?, aborted_flow? }`.
- If nothing is active → no-op; return `{ ok: true, summary: "Nothing to abort." }`.
</confirmation_lifecycle>

<invalidates_on_change>
## Downstream-slot invalidation (`ActionDef.invalidatesOnChange`)

A per-action map declaring "if this action re-collects slot X with a *different* value, reset everything derived from X to `null`." Keys are slot names the action may write; values are the downstream slots to clear.

```ts
verify_customer: {
  // …
  invalidatesOnChange: {
    customerCode: ["cardVerified", "amountCollected", "reasoningCollected", /* … */],
  },
},
```

Fire rule (evaluated after the executor's `stateUpdate` has been folded in):
- Fires only when the watched slot's pre-step value was **non-null** AND the written value is not **deep-VALUE-equal** to it (canonicalized-JSON compare — reference identity never counts, so an executor writing a fresh-but-value-equal object does NOT fire).
- First-time set (`null → value`) does NOT fire — there was nothing downstream to invalidate yet.
- Same-value writes (no real change) do NOT fire — including a fresh object with identical contents.
- Slots set later in the same batch are NOT retro-cleared; an executor's own writes to a downstream slot win over the cascade.

Invalidated slots are written as `null` regardless of their declared type, so any slot listed as a target must accept `null` as its "unset" sentinel. CAUTION: the `null` must also survive the HOST's reducer for that slot — list only **replace-on-write** slots as invalidation targets. A record-merge reducer (`{...prev, ...(next ?? {})}`) swallows the `null` at the graph boundary, so the slot resurrects on the next turn even though the in-batch view saw it cleared.
</invalidates_on_change>

<otp_lifecycle>
## OTP gate (when `issuesOtp` / `requiresOtp` are set)

Two actions cooperate: the **issuer** mints an SCA challenge; the **consumer** validates the customer's OTP. Library coordinates `awaitingInput.kind === "otp"`.

### Issuer (`controller.issuesOtp = { consumer_action }`)
- Executor calls the SCA backend to mint a challenge.
- On the ok verdict, the return carries `effects: [{ type: "otp_issued" }, { type: "merge_flow_data", data: { challengeId, customerId, ... } }]` (on the row or the executor return) — the merge carries the challenge details so the consumer can read them from `currentFlow.data`; surface caller-facing bits (e.g. a masked mobile) on the row's body / `resultExtras`.
- Library sets `awaitingInput = { kind: "otp", for_action: consumer_action, flow_ref: currentFlow.name }`.

Issuer typically also declares `startsFlow: { name: "X" }` so the OTP gate is tied to a flow.

**Re-send without aborting.** While the issued gate is pending, the OTP lockdown admits a **same-flow issuer** of that gate as the batch's first step: an action whose `issuesOtp.consumer_action` is the gate's `for_action` AND whose `requiresFlow` equals the gate's `flow_ref`. A code that never arrived (or expired unnoticed) can thus be re-sent without `abort_pending_input` — which would take the whole flow, and everything captured in it, down with it. Re-issuing replaces the gate with a fresh one, so "one gate at a time, belonging to the flow" is untouched. The admission is deliberately scoped: an issuer for the same consumer that belongs to a DIFFERENT flow is not a re-send and stays locked out (`otp_pending_locked`), and a `startsFlow`-only issuer (no `requiresFlow`) is not admitted — give the re-sendable issuer a `requiresFlow` tying it to the gate's flow.

**Match-then-OTP ordering guard.** An `issuesOtp` step is refused (pre-execution, so the SCA backend is never called) when a double-entry **match** gate is still pending in the live view — error `otp_blocked_match_pending` — **unless the issuer is that match's own consumer** (the pending gate's `for_action`). The guard enforces "at most one input gate at a time, match before OTP": without it, a `[capturer, issuer]` batch would mint+send the OTP and overwrite the still-pending match gate, skipping the second entry entirely. When the issuer IS the consumer that hazard cannot arise — it is running right now and clears the gate as it goes — so the folded "confirming the value sends the code" shape (one action declaring both `requiresMatch` and `issuesOtp`) is allowed: on its ok verdict the consumed match is cleared first, then `otp_issued` opens the OTP gate (consume-before-issue, see the apply order in `<state_threading>`); on a mismatch the issue never happens (effects ride the ok row only) and the match gate stands. The check reads the **live** view (not batch-start), so the legitimate `[consumer, issuer]` batch still works — the consumer clears the match earlier in the same batch, so no match is pending by the time the issuer runs.

### Consumer (`controller.requiresOtp = true`)
- Refused unless `awaitingInput.kind === "otp" && for_action === <this action>`. Error: `otp_not_pending` if the gate isn't pending; `otp_pending_locked` if something else is awaiting.
- Executor reads `challengeId` (etc.) from `state.currentFlow.data`, calls SCA validate.
- Library **does not count OTP attempts**. The backend is authoritative for lock / timeout / wrong:
  - **valid** → an `ok: true` verdict; library auto-clears `awaitingInput`. Flow continues.
  - **wrong, retry allowed** → an `ok: false` verdict (no effects). Library leaves state alone; customer re-reads the same code.
  - **timeout** → an `ok: false` verdict whose row (or return) carries `effects: [{ type: "clear_awaiting_input" }]`. The gate dies; the LLM offers to resend (re-call the issuer to mint a fresh challenge).
  - **lockout** → an `ok: false` verdict with `effects: [{ type: "abort_flow" }]`. The flow is dead; library clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow`.

### Single consumer, multiple issuers
A single `confirm_otp` action can serve every OTP-protected flow in the tool. Each issuer points its `issuesOtp.consumer_action` at that one consumer, and the consumer reads `currentFlow.data` to know which challenge is in play.
</otp_lifecycle>

<match_lifecycle>
## Double-entry match gate (when `startsMatchFor` / `requiresMatch` are set)

The customer provides a value once, then again; the system verifies they match. Used for PIN setup, password change, secret-answer confirmation. Library coordinates `awaitingInput.kind === "match"`.

### Capturer (`controller.startsMatchFor = { consumer_action }`)
- Executor validates/encodes/persists the first entry (typically into flow data, via a `merge_flow_data` effect).
- On the ok verdict, library sets `awaitingInput = { kind: "match", for_action: consumer_action, attempts_left: maxAttempts, max_attempts: maxAttempts, flow_ref? }`.
- Re-running the capturer while a match is awaiting **resets** `attempts_left` (lets the customer change their first entry).

### Consumer (`controller.requiresMatch = { capturer, maxAttempts }`)
- Refused unless `awaitingInput.kind === "match" && for_action === <this action>`. Error: `match_not_pending` if absent.
- **Same-batch double-entry is refused (batch-start freeze).** The gate check reads the awaiting-input snapshot as it stood at **batch start**, not the live in-batch view — so a match gate the capturer opens *earlier in the same batch* is NOT consumable by the consumer in that same batch. The double-entry repeat must arrive in a SEPARATE turn (mirrors the confirmation same-batch-bypass protection). A `[capturer, consumer]` batch fails at the consumer with `match_not_pending`; the legitimate `[consumer, issuer]` batch is unaffected (the consumer's gate was opened in a prior turn, so it IS present at batch start).
- Executor receives the second entry, owns the comparison (e.g. compares ciphertexts), performs the side-effect on match.
- Library reads the verdict's outcome:
  - `ok: true` → match succeeded; library auto-clears `awaitingInput`. Pair with `endsFlow: true` to wrap the flow — or with `issuesOtp` for the folded "confirming the value sends the code" shape (the consumed match is cleared, then the OTP gate opens; see `<otp_lifecycle>`).
  - `ok: false` + body `verdict === "match_mismatch"` → library decrements `attempts_left`. On exhaustion, library clears `awaitingInput` AND `currentFlow` (terminal) and surfaces `verdict: "match_attempts_exhausted"`, `error: "match_attempts_exhausted"`.
  - `ok: false` + any other verdict → library leaves state alone (unrelated failure, e.g. backend error).

### Lockdown
While `awaitingInput.kind === "match"`, only three actions are allowed as the first step: the consumer, the capturer (re-capture), or `abort_pending_input`.
</match_lifecycle>

<caller_turn_identity>
## Caller-turn identity (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.getCallerTurnId`)

The confirmation gate's protections key on a **stable identity for the latest caller turn**: the same-turn lock (`<confirmation_lifecycle>`) and the repeat control's presentation-turn provenance. By default the runner resolves it as the **latest human/user message id** in `state.messages` — LangGraph's messages reducer assigns missing ids before a node sees state, so this is stable across every ReAct loop within one caller turn and independent of history length.

- Hosts that **compact or replace messages** must provide `getCallerTurnId: (state) => string | null | undefined` returning a stable, non-compacted turn token.
- When no identity exists (e.g. direct `runSteps` calls with message-less fixtures), the confirmation same-turn guard is **deliberately unavailable** (params-only behavior) — the runner never guesses.
- The hook (and the message scan) is only consulted when a confirm gate is actually configured — hosts using none never pay for it.
- **`resolveCallerTurnId(state, getCallerTurnId?)` is exported** (from `interaction/turn-identity.ts` since 3.0.0) so hosts stop re-deriving this. It returns the host hook's value when configured, else the latest human message id; blank/whitespace collapses to `undefined` (identity unavailable). Pass the same `getCallerTurnId` you gave `buildAgentStepTool`, or the two halves will disagree about where a turn starts.
</caller_turn_identity>

<pagination>
## Read pagination (`pageable`)

A LIST read opts in with `pageable` on its `ActionDef`. The runner then injects optional `page` / `pageSize` params into the action's schema (so the model can ask for a page), runs/serves the read, and emits a **uniform envelope** spread into the StepResult:

```ts
{ page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages, hasMore, items, fromCache }
```

The row's other composed fields (e.g. `summary`) are preserved on every page, including cache hits. Two modes:

- **`pageable: true`** — **self-paginate.** The executor returns the **FULL set** as `items` (via `resultExtras.items`); the runner slices the requested page and caches the full set in the library-managed `pagedRead` slot. A same-query re-page (same params minus `page`/`pageSize`) is served from the cache **without re-running the executor** (`fromCache: true`).
- **`pageable: "delegate"`** — **backend pages.** The executor reads the injected `page`/`pageSize`, returns that page as `items` plus `totalCount`; the runner just wraps it (no cache).
- **`pageable: { mode, pageSize?, maxPageSize? }`** — same, with tuned sizes (defaults: `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=10`, `MAX_PAGE_SIZE=50`).

**Constraint:** a `pageable` action's `paramsSchema` MUST be a `z.object` (the runner merges `page`/`pageSize` in) — otherwise construction throws.

**Primitives** (exported from `index.ts`, for hand-rolled cases — the runner uses them internally): `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`, `clampPageSize`, `querySignature`, `pageRows`, `buildPageEnvelope`, and types `PageEnvelope`, `PagedCache`, `PageableSpec`. Prefer the `pageable` opt over hand-rolling.
</pagination>

<caller_digit_capture>
## Caller capture params (`callerDigits` / `digitGroupsParam` / `digitCandidatesParam` / `callerTextParam` / `relayParam` / `exactlyOneOf`)

Schema helpers for params that carry **caller-dictated values** (a tax number, a card-number tail, a spoken name). Unlike `paginate.ts` — whose primitives the runner itself uses — this module is **authoring-only**: nothing in the runner calls it. It lives in the library because each rule below is a consequence of a runner contract, so a host that hand-rolls the field re-derives (or misses) them one live failure at a time:

- **Shape rules are refinements, never `.regex()` / `.min()` / `.max()`.** A `.regex()` becomes a `pattern` keyword in the model-facing JSON Schema (and `.min`/`.max` become `minLength`/`maxLength`), turning the tool's validation into a precondition the model must satisfy before it may call. The model then counts digits itself — unreliable on grouped STT captures — and either **withholds the call** (answers the caller instead; a valid capture never reaches the tool) or **pads an invented digit** to satisfy the pattern. The builders keep the wire type plain; the runner's propose-path parse bounces a bad shape as recoverable `invalid_params` — before any read-back, without spending a confirmation attempt.
- **Refinement messages carry no digit count.** Issue text rides the StepResult's `_debug` back to the model; "must be exactly 9 digits" re-introduces through the error path the very constraint the refinement keeps out of the schema. Say WHAT failed ("not a usable capture"), never HOW MANY DIGITS.
- **Representation flips must not read as drift.** The confirmation gate compares schema-PARSED params, so `["7070"]` ≡ `"7070"` and separator variants must normalize identically — the separator strip and the singleton-array collapse live in the preprocess, before the compare.
- **The declared type is the honest wire union.** A field that accepts digit GROUPS carries the array branch in its TYPE — a preprocess is invisible to the model's schema, and with a bare string type a group-array call bounces as a raw schema error instead of the runner's voice-safe `invalid_params`.

The builders (each takes a **required** `describe` — the library ships NO model-facing wording; field text is live prompt surface, owned and QA-gated per host):

- **`digitGroupsParam({ shape, message, describe })`** — the "transcription field": the model transcribes one array entry per **spoken digit group** («δεκαεπτά, είκοσι ένα, πενήντα δύο, δύο, ογδόντα δύο» → `["17","21","52","2","82"]`) or a single string; the JOIN happens in the preprocess, never in the model (models regroup, drop repeated groups, and lose the zero of round tens). `shape` validates the JOINED value. Omission stays `undefined` — the host's channel for "consume a carried/collected value".
- **`digitCandidatesParam({ shape, message, candidateMessage?, maxCandidates?, describe })`** — the ambiguous-reading field: a single digit string, or an array of EVERY plausible reading of one utterance («χίλια τρία» → `["1003","10003"]`) for the executor to try — the model never picks a reading itself.
- **`callerTextParam({ min, max, shortMessage, longMessage, describe })`** (3.0.0) — a caller-dictated TEXT capture (a spoken name, a free-form answer): trim + bounded length as a REFINEMENT with count-free messages — the text analogue of `callerDigits`.
- **`relayParam(describe)`** (3.0.0) — a relay-only transcription field: the caller's exact words, OPTIONAL, passed through for the SYSTEM to classify — the model never translates, normalizes, or invents them. Mechanically a described optional string; the builder NAMES the intent (stenographer field).
- **`exactlyOneOf(fields, message)`** (3.0.0) — an exactly-one-of selector for a params object (XOR over optional fields) as a refinement, applied via `z.object({...}).superRefine(exactlyOneOf([...], msg))` — the model-facing JSON Schema stays a plain object, and a bad shape bounces as recoverable `invalid_params` on the propose path.

**Description authoring (the part the host owns).** The proven register for `describe` — adapt, don't invent:
- Frame the field as **pure transcription** ("you are a stenographer here"): write down the digit groups exactly as heard, in spoken order; never concatenate, merge, regroup, shorten, extend, count, or judge; a group is never dropped because it repeats its neighbour; the SYSTEM sanitizes, joins, and does ALL validation, answering `invalid_params` on an unusable capture.
- Keep the field **semantically neutral**: naming the domain entity ("the AFM") or its length ("nine digits") re-activates the model's world knowledge — the measured source of withheld calls and reshaped captures no prompt scrub fully suppresses.
- Give 2–3 concrete renderings in the caller's language(s), e.g. `«10, 2, 22. 8078» → ["10","2","22","8078"]`.
- If omission consumes a carried value, say exactly that ("Omit the field entirely to consume …") — omission semantics belong in the field text, not only the prompt.
- Bound a capture's re-ask loop with `captureBounces` (see `<ladders>`) rather than prompt counting.
</caller_digit_capture>

<handoff>
## Library-coordinated channel handoff (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.handoff`)

Opt-in machinery for a SPECIALIZED agent's off-topic plays (see `streaming-and-channel-contract.md` `<agent_roles>`): delegate the turn to another deployment and keep the conversation, or hand the conversation back. Two cooperating halves — the runner writes a slot; a host graph node resolves it.

### Runner half (opt-in)

Pass `handoff: HandoffSpec<T>` to `buildAgentStepTool`. The runner then:

- Auto-injects the reserved **`request_handoff`** control into the tool schema (with the opt provided, declaring it in `config.actions` throws; WITHOUT the opt the name is free — the orchestrator/scaffold mechanism uses it for its own action). Params = `HandoffRequestSchema`: `{ reason: "off_topic" | "completed" | "abandon", context }` — `context` is the customer's request for `off_topic`, the closing line for `completed` / `abandon`.
- Handles the action internally as an **atomic slot transition** — validates params, clears every transient runner slot (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `pagedRead`), writes the `handoff` slot into view + committed state, and returns an ok result telling the model the turn ends here. No I/O in the runner. A verdict row or executor requests the same terminal transition (identical atomic cleanup) via the `request_handoff` effect — never by writing the slot through `stateUpdate`, which throws.
- Enforces **exclusivity**: batched with anything else ⇒ the whole batch is refused with `error: "handoff_must_be_sole_step"`, nothing executes.
- **No prereqs**, and allowed as the first step under input lockdown (pending confirmation / OTP / match) — "transfer me" must work before any data is loaded and cannot be blocked by a pending gate.

### Graph half (`createHandoffNode`)

                                     // escalation routes (ladder onExhaust contexts) are deliberately
                                     // OMITTED from it, so the engine holds the only path to them.
}
```

**`resolveClosingMessage`** lets the host gate the spoken closing on what actually happened: e.g. only
speak a success line for `completed` when the mutating action truly persisted, otherwise return a
neutral/failed phrasing. It runs in `createHandoffNode` for `completed` / `abandon` only; a returned
string becomes the final message `content` (and `handoff_metadata.success_message`), `undefined` falls
through to `request.context`.

**State can decide the signal and the metadata (2.3.0).** `resolveHandoffType` is resolved **before the
first control-plane event**, so the `handoff` custom event, the closing line, `handoff_type` and
`handoff_metadata.service_type` all carry one value. An override can only swap `completed` ↔ `abandon`;
it can never produce or erase an `off_topic`, so delegate detection and the clearing gate below are
unaffected by construction. `resolveHandoffMetadata` is the same move for host-derived fields: they are
spread FIRST and the library's keys applied last, so a host cannot clobber the contract.

**Terminality is declared on verdict rows (3.0.0).** The resolver reads only the armed `handoff`
slot: `createHandoffNode` resolves `state.handoff`, and the graph routes on `handoffRequested(state)`
alone. A terminal business outcome arms its handoff ATOMICALLY via the verdict row's
`request_handoff` effect — the row that writes the outcome carries the effect, so "terminal but
nothing armed" is unreachable by construction. (The 2.3.0 `forcedHandoff` state-predicate net — and
its `forcedHandoffRequested` edge predicate — were REMOVED in 3.0.0: the hook duplicated executor
outcome sets in the spec, and its `clearsOnHandback` coupling carried a re-fire-forever trap. A host
whose terminality was INPUT-derived — a predicate over raw invoke fields, reachable with no executor
run — converts it to a first-turn probe action whose executor answers the fact as a verdict row
carrying the terminal effect.)

**Task-scoped state is cleared when the task ends (2.2.0).** The THREAD outlives the TASK: a channel
middleware reuses one thread id for a whole call and never resets it on re-dispatch, so whatever sits
in state when a handback resolves is what the NEXT task on that thread starts from. On `completed` /
`abandon` in terminate mode, `createHandoffNode` therefore nulls the library's own
`agentStepTaskScopedSlots` (`awaitingInput`, `currentFlow`, `pagedRead`, `spentLadders`, `errorCount`)
plus every domain slot the host named in **`clearsOnHandback`**. Two carve-outs, both correctness
invariants rather than preferences, so neither is configurable: **`off_topic` clears nothing** (a
mid-task aside must stay resumable — the caller can come straight back; a spent ladder stays spent),
and **a successful delegate clears nothing** (the conversation never left this agent). The closing
line, the signal, and any `resolveClosingMessage` reading state are all computed before the clear, so
the reply is unaffected.

Declare `clearsOnHandback` when the host graph derives anything from a terminal domain slot — an
escalation, a "this task already finished" branch. Left undeclared, such a slot survives into the next
task and re-fires its branch on every later turn of the same call. Slots whose reducer MERGES cannot
be cleared this way (the write is a plain `null`); reset those through the pointer slot that selects
from them.

**Asides mid-task**: the free-deflection damper that was `HandoffSpec.deflectAside` (2.4.0) is now a
LADDER — configure an aside ladder in the `ladders` registry (instruction: decline in one short
sentence and re-ask in the same turn; `onExhaust`: the `off_topic` handback carrying the aside as
routing context) and let the prompt route nobody-serves-it chit-chat to `note_refusal`. Same policy,
one mechanism, one latch (see `<ladders>`).

Exports: `HANDOFF_ACTION` (`"request_handoff"`), `HANDOFF_NODE` (`"resolve_handoff"` — a node can't be named `handoff`, the state channel claims it), `HANDOFF_ACTION_DESCRIPTION`, `HANDBACK_SIGNALS` (reason → `handoff_type` signal; identity over `off_topic` / `completed` / `abandon`), `handoffParamsSchema`, `handoffRequested(state)` (edge predicate), `createHandoffNode(spec)`, and types `HandoffSpec`, `HandoffOffTopicSpec`, `HandoffDelegateTarget`.

Wire a conditional edge after the tool node — `createReactAgent` cannot express it, so the graph is hand-rolled: `addConditionalEdges("tools", s => handoffRequested(s) ? HANDOFF_NODE : "agent")`, `addNode(HANDOFF_NODE, createHandoffNode(spec))`, `addEdge(HANDOFF_NODE, END)`. The node emits a `handoff` custom event FIRST (streaming clients abort TTS / reroute before any content), resolves the response (terminate envelope, or a delegate run over the Platform API with live `delegated_token` pass-through and a behavioral fallback to the envelope on failure), emits `handoff_complete`, and returns `{ handoff: null, ...clears, messages: [AIMessage] }` (the clears are empty unless a task-ending handback resolved — see above) — the model never paraphrases the result.

**Final-message kwargs** (the channel contract): every non-delegate resolution is a handback — `is_handoff: true`, `handoff_type` = the effective reason's signal (`off_topic` / `completed` / `abandon`, after any `resolveHandoffType`), `handoff_reason` = `context`, `handoff_metadata: { ...host fields from resolveHandoffMetadata, service_type, success_message }` — host fields first, library keys last and unclobberable. Spoken content: the `off_topic` envelope (`terminateMessage`, also the delegate-failure fallback) or the closing in `context` for `completed` / `abandon` (the middleware delivers it and flips routing for the NEXT request). Delegate success → NOT a handoff (conversation kept) — informational `{ delegated_to }` only. Streaming clients must request `stream_mode: ["messages-tuple", "custom"]` — the node-built final message never appears in the token stream; `handoff_complete` carries its text. Full wire details + the middleware checklist: `streaming-and-channel-contract.md`.

<system_messages>
## Runner-emitted system messages (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions.messages`)

The runner emits its own `summary` strings for structured refusals/errors it raises directly (not from a verdict row): executor crash, invalid params, unknown action, the abort outcomes, the flow gates, the lockdown/batch-shape refusals, and the confirmation/OTP/match gate outcomes — plus the model-facing CONTRACTS that ride result bodies (reply contracts, the standing-ask contract, the read-back framing directives). **Every runner-emitted string is overridable.** These ship as **neutral English defaults** in `src/agent-step/messages.ts` so the library has ZERO dependency on any host project.

```ts
interface SystemMessages {
  executor_error: string;     // an executor threw / named an undeclared verdict (raw cause in `_debug`)
  invalid_params: string;     // step params failed schema validation (raw detail in `_debug`)
  unknown_action: string;     // a hallucinated/typo'd action name reached the runner
  flow_already_active: string;// tried to open a flow while a different flow is active
  no_flow: string;            // a flow-scoped step ran with no flow active
  wrong_flow: string;         // a flow-scoped step ran against the wrong flow
  abort_done: string;         // abort_pending_input cleared a pending gate / active flow
  abort_nothing: string;      // abort_pending_input ran with nothing pending (no-op)
  auto_handoff: string;       // spoken when the auto-handoff threshold is hit (see <auto_handoff>)

  // Templated summaries — may carry `{placeholder}` tokens the runner
  // interpolates at emit time (via `formatMessage`; unknown placeholders stay
  // verbatim so a bad override is visible, not silently blanked). Overrides
  // are plain strings, so they can live in a host's JSON locale resources.
  lockdown_confirmation: string;         // {action} {abort_action}
  lockdown_otp: string;                  // {action} {abort_action}
  lockdown_match: string;                // {action} {capturer} {abort_action}
  handoff_must_be_sole_step: string;     // {action}
  mutation_must_be_sole_step: string;    // {action}
  mutation_execute_must_be_sole: string; // {action}
  mutation_must_be_last_in_batch: string;// {action}
  confirm_proposed: string;              // {action}
  confirm_reproposed: string;            // {action}
  confirm_exhausted: string;             // {action}
  otp_not_pending: string;               // {action}
  match_not_pending: string;             // {action} {capturer}
  otp_blocked_match_pending: string;     // {action} {match_action}
  match_attempts_exhausted: string;      // {action}
  handoff_requested: string;             // {reason}
  no_steps: string;                      // (no placeholders)
  auto_handoff_instruction: string;      // {message} — see <auto_handoff>

  // Model-facing CONTRACTS riding result bodies (3.0.0) — the gate/ask turns
  // react to these wire bytes instead of prompt memory:
  confirm_reply_contract: string;        // {action} — the GENERIC reply contract on every proposal
                                         // (replaced per-action by a composed replyContract)
  standing_ask_contract: string;         // {action} {param} — rides the entry that recorded a
                                         // standing ask (see <standing_asks>); includes the
                                         // repeated-value clause (a reply repeating an
                                         // already-refused value still calls — the engine counts
                                         // those turns for captureBounces)
  read_back_directive_repeat: string;    // framing directive on the repeat control's returned
                                         // read_back: the stored recap is complete and ends the turn
}
```

A host overrides any subset via `buildAgentStepTool({ messages })` (`Partial<SystemMessages>`, **shallow-merged** over `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`). Use this for localized / voice-safe wording on a TTS or non-English agent — and remember the contract strings are MODEL-facing (never caller-audible): they stay English on a Greek agent, but a host may tighten their taxonomy (the reference host overrides `standing_ask_contract` with domain reply categories). The library never imports host strings; the host injects them.

Exports (from `index.ts`): `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`, `resolveSystemMessages(overrides?)`, type `SystemMessages`. Note these are the **runner's own** strings only — a verdict row's `summary` (the LLM-facing per-action text) is authored on the row and is unaffected.
</system_messages>

<auto_handoff>
## Auto-handoff on repeated backend failures

A safety net so a customer is never trapped in an unrecoverable backend-error loop. The runner keeps a consecutive **backend-failure** counter in the library-managed `errorCount` slot; when it reaches a threshold the runner auto-triggers a handoff.

**What counts as a backend failure.** The runner-raised **`executor_error`** (an executor threw, or named an undeclared verdict) ALWAYS counts. A verdict row with **`backendFailure: true`** marks its static `body.error` code as counting — this DERIVES the code list from the declarations, so the hand-kept list disappears; `BuildAgentStepToolOptions.backendFailureCodes` remains for codes that reach the wire outside any row. List ONLY true backend/network failures. User mistakes (wrong OTP, value mismatch) and business-logic refusals are recoverable and must NOT count, or the counter will escalate recoverable situations. The counter resets to 0 only when a batch in which an executor **actually ran** ends without a backend failure — executed work is the only proof the backend recovered. Batches where no executor ran (confirm-gate proposals/re-proposals, prereq or param refusals, aborts, handoff signals) are **neutral**: they neither increment nor reset, so the proposal a confirm gate interleaves between two failing executes cannot wipe the streak.

```ts
// BuildAgentStepToolOptions additions
backendFailureCodes?: string[];   // extra codes that count (executor_error + backendFailure rows
                                  // always count)
errorHandoffThreshold?: number;   // default 3
onErrorThreshold?: (update: Record<string, unknown>, state: T) => void;
                                  // host hook fired at the threshold — inject a custom
                                  // handoff signal (e.g. write a scaffold `pendingHandoff` slot)
```

**At the threshold the runner:** (1) writes the library `handoff` slot `{ reason: "abandon", context: messages.auto_handoff }` when the `handoff` opt is enabled; (2) calls `onErrorThreshold(committed, state)` if provided; (3) resets `errorCount` to 0; (4) appends a synthetic step result `{ action: "auto_handoff", ok: true, isHandoff: true, signal: "abandon", successMessage: <auto_handoff> }`, sets `body.summary` to the **`auto_handoff_instruction`** template, and clears `failed_at`.

**Who speaks the closing.** The default `auto_handoff_instruction` tells the model the turn ends here and to produce NO further answer — **the platform delivers the closing** (a `createHandoffNode` graph speaks the handoff `context`; a scaffold/middleware host speaks `success_message` from the final-message kwargs). A host whose graph does NOT deliver the closing overrides `auto_handoff_instruction` and uses the `{message}` placeholder (= the `auto_handoff` closing) to have the model speak it.

**Inert by default.** The whole mechanism is skipped unless a handoff path exists — i.e. the `handoff` opt is provided OR `onErrorThreshold` is set. A tool with neither never touches `errorCount`.
</auto_handoff>

<result_envelope>
## What the LLM sees per tool call

```ts
interface RunnerResultBody {
  summary: string;                 // last step's summary (success) OR failing step's summary
  results: StepResult[];           // one entry per executed step
  failed_at?: number;              // index into results where batch short-circuited
}

interface StepResult {
  action: string;
  ok: boolean;
  [key: string]: unknown;          // the row-composed body fields spread in
}
```

The `summary` of a runner-emitted refusal/error (executor crash, invalid params, abort, flow gates) is a **host-overridable system message** — see `<system_messages>`. For the `executor_error` and `invalid_params` kinds the runner also attaches a **`_debug`** field carrying the raw technical cause (the thrown message / the Zod issue list), so the overridable `summary` can stay user-safe while the diagnostic detail is preserved for logs.

Library-injected fields on specific step kinds:
- `abort_pending_input` results carry `aborted_awaiting: { kind, for_action }` and/or `aborted_flow: "<name>"` when something was actually cleared.
- `executor_error` / `invalid_params` results carry `_debug` with the raw cause (the `summary` itself is the overridable system message).
- `issuesOtp` refused while a match gate is pending carries `error: "otp_blocked_match_pending"`.
- propose / re-propose results carry `needs_confirmation: true`, `proposed_params`, `attempts_left`, a **`reply_contract`** (the composed action-specific contract, or the generic `confirm_reply_contract`), and — when the action declares `ConfirmationOpts.readBack` and it renders something — `read_back` (proposal-only; never on the executing re-call) plus `read_back_directive` when `readBackDirective` renders.
- exhausted results carry `error: "confirmation_attempts_exhausted"`.
- lockdown refusals carry `error: "pending_confirmation_locked" | "otp_pending_locked" | "match_pending_locked"` and `awaiting: { kind, for_action }`.
- match-mismatch results gain `attempts_left` (decremented) or `verdict: "match_attempts_exhausted"` on the last try.
- a matching confirm re-call on the proposal's own caller turn carries `error: "confirmation_same_turn_locked"` (no attempt spent; gate untouched).
- the final entry that recorded a standing ask carries `standing_ask: { action, param }`, `ask_contract`, and `ask_text` when the ask's `render` returned bytes (see `<standing_asks>`).
- `repeat_pending_question` results carry the stored `read_back` + the `read_back_directive_repeat` framing.
- `note_refusal` results carry `refusal_noted: true` and the ladder's `instruction` as summary on a free use, or `ladder_exhausted: true, handoff_requested: true, reason` on the escalation (see `<ladders>`).

<construction_time_checks>
The runner validates the config + registries at construction. These all throw at startup before any user input — fix the misconfig before continuing:

| Error message contains | Cause |
|------------------------|-------|
| `requires \`stateSchema\`` | `stateSchema` not provided |
| `is a reserved action name` | You declared `abort_pending_input` in config.actions (or `request_handoff` while the `handoff` opt is provided, or `note_refusal` while `ladders` is non-empty, or `repeat_pending_question` while some action opts into `repeatReadBack`) |
| `expects a state selector at selectors["xxx"]` | `selectors` registry missing the action-name key for an action |
| `expects an executor at executors["xxx"]` | `executors` registry missing the action-name key for an action |
| `is missing a non-empty description` | An action lacks `description` |
| `verifiers["xxx"] was not provided` | A prereq referenced by some action has no verifier |
| `pageable action's paramsSchema must be a z.object` | A `pageable` action's `paramsSchema` isn't a `z.object` |
| `at least one action must be defined` | Empty `config.actions` |
| `declares startsMatchFor "X" but that consumer doesn't declare requiresMatch` | Capturer names a consumer that exists but lacks the `requiresMatch` hook |
| `declares issuesOtp for "X" but no such action exists` | `issuesOtp.consumer_action` names a non-existent action |
| `declares requiresMatch with capturer "X" but no such action exists` | `requiresMatch.capturer` names a non-existent action |
| `the state schema is missing channel(s)` | Channel-completeness check: a library slot this configuration writes has no channel in the host schema — spread `agentStepZodShape` / `agentStepStateSpec` |
| `has a verdicts entry with an empty code` | A `verdicts` row keyed by an empty string |
| `sets backendFailure but body.error is not a static string` | A `backendFailure: true` row whose `body.error` is missing or dynamic — the failure counter matches on that code (3.0.0) |
| `asks["xxx"] targets unknown action` / `names param "xxx" which is not declared` / `has invalid expects` | Standing-ask validation (3.0.0): the mapped target action must exist and the named param must be a declared field of its params schema |
| `enables repeatReadBack but declares no replyContract` | A repeatable gate routes re-asks through the repeat control, which the generic reply contract forbids — declare the gate's own reply taxonomy (3.0.0) |
| `composeGateContract requires …` | A `replyContract` spec with an empty `subject`/`subjectNoun`/`executesLabel` or no categories (a yes/no-only gate keeps the generic contract instead) |
| `ladders require handoff` | A non-empty `ladders` registry without the `handoff` opt — every ladder escalates into one (3.0.0) |
| `ladder "xxx" …` | Ladder validation (3.0.0): empty name/description/instruction, `maxFreeUses` < 1, or an `onExhaust` that fails `handoffParamsSchema` |
| `captureBounces … not a configured ladder` | An action's `captureBounces.ladder` names no entry in the `ladders` registry (3.0.0) |
| `abortPolicy …` | Abort-policy validation (2.5.0): non-boolean knobs, empty/duplicate/unknown action names in `allowedFollowers` / `allowedPendingTargets`, or `allowStandalone=false` with an explicitly empty follower list |
| `handoff.modelRequestSchema must be a Zod schema` | The model-facing handoff schema narrowing isn't a Zod schema |

Runtime errors raised by the runner (not construction-time, but loud):

| Error message contains | Cause |
|------------------------|-------|
| `returned undeclared verdict` | An executor named a verdict with no row in `ActionDef.verdicts` — declared rows ARE the result space (surfaces as `executor_error` on the wire) |
| `wrote library-managed slot(s) … through stateUpdate` | Executor patched `awaitingInput` / `currentFlow` / `pagedRead` / `spentLadders` / `handoff` / `errorCount` via `stateUpdate` — request the transition as a typed effect instead |
| `requested merge_flow_data but no flow is active` | Executor emitted `merge_flow_data` without `startsFlow` and no flow is open |
| `reported otp_issued but no flow is active` | Issuer didn't pair with `startsFlow` |
| `reported otp_issued but config lacks issuesOtp opt` | Executor returned the effect but the action's config didn't declare `issuesOtp` |
| `otp_blocked_match_pending` (step error) | An `issuesOtp` step ran while a double-entry match gate was still pending — consume the match before issuing the OTP; the match's own consumer is exempt and may issue (see `<otp_lifecycle>`) |

Slot declaration is enforced at construction (the channel-completeness row above) — a state schema missing a required library slot fails at startup instead of silently dropping writes. Spreading `agentStepZodShape` into your Zod state schema (as the bootstrap state template does) brings all six slots in together with their reducers.

- `src/agent-step/messages.ts` — the runner's overridable strings: `SystemMessages`, `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGES`, `resolveSystemMessages`
- Tests (all pass on `npm test`): `runner.test.ts`, `paginate.test.ts`, `capture.test.ts`, `capture-bounce.test.ts`, `handoff.test.ts`, `hardening.test.ts`, `repeat-question.test.ts`, `note-refusal.test.ts`, `dictation.test.ts`, `verdict-map.test.ts`, `action-describe.test.ts`, `gate-contract.test.ts`, `zod-state.test.ts` — worked examples covering every runner branch, the declared-verdict normalization, the standing-ask lifecycle, the ladder mechanism, the capture-bounce bound, the composed descriptions/contracts, and the stored-byte question repeat
