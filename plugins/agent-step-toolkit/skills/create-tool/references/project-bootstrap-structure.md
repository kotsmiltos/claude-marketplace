# Reference: Project Bootstrap Structure

<overview>
The shape produced by the `bootstrap-project` workflow. This is a complete LangGraph TypeScript agent project, with the agent-step runner library embedded, ready for the first tool to be added via the `create-tool` workflow.

## Config files

**package.json** — Declares dependencies (`@langchain/core`, `@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/openai`, `dotenv`, `zod`) and dev-deps (`@langchain/langgraph-cli`, `tsx`, `typescript`, `@types/node`). Scripts: `build`, `typecheck`, `test` (runner unit tests — fast, no backend, no LLM), `test:sandbox` (per-tool sandbox tests — needs the local sandbox), `test:prompt` (prompt-input tests — live model, sets `PROMPT_INPUT_LIVE=1`), `test:all` (unit + sandbox), `dev` (LangGraph dev server on :2024), `cli` (in-process REPL). The `test:sandbox` / `test:prompt` scripts use a guarded `find` so they're clean no-ops until a tool ships tests.

**tsconfig.json** — ESM, Node 20+, `target: ES2022`, `module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `strict: true`. Outputs to `dist/`.

**langgraph.json** — Tells the LangGraph dev server which file exports the graph (`./src/graph.ts:graph`) and where to load env from (`.env`).

**.env.example** — Lists every env var the project consumes. The user copies to `.env` and fills in real values.

**.gitignore** — Standard: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.langgraph_api/`, `*.log`.

**Dockerfile** — Based on `langchain/langgraphjs-api:20`. Builds the project for deployment to ACR or any other registry. `LANGSERVE_GRAPHS` env tells the prod runtime which graph to serve.

**build_and_push.sh** — Cross-platform buildx + ACR login + push. Cards-style template; adapt the registry / image name.

## Library: src/agent-step/

Verbatim copy of the runner library. The skill treats these as templates-by-copy (no substitution). Top-level files plus five phase-module directories (`compile/`, `run/`, `interaction/`, `controls/`, `handoff/` — internal layout; hosts import only from `index.ts`):

- **types.ts** — the authoring contracts: `AgentStepConfig` (`{ tool, actions }`), `ActionDef` (with inline `controller: ControllerHooks` + `invalidatesOnChange`), `ControllerHooks` (batch-shape opts + confirmation / OTP / match / flow lifecycle opts), `ConfirmationOpts`, `Verifier`, `ExecutorResult` + `ExecutorEffect` (the typed library-state transitions an executor may request).
- **state.ts** — the library-managed state slots: `AwaitingInputSchema` (discriminated union over confirmation / otp / match) → `AwaitingInput`, `CurrentFlowSchema` → `CurrentFlow`, `BoundedChoiceSchema` → `BoundedChoice` (the one-shot choice overlay), `PagedCacheSchema`, `HandoffRequestSchema` → `HandoffRequest` (the library handoff request slot), `deflectedAside` (the one-shot aside-deflection latch, task-scoped), `guardTurn` (the turn-scoped guard latch's map, host-written via `markGuardFired`); the `agentStepZodShape` fragment hosts spread into their Zod state schema (each slot wrapped with `withLangGraph`, carrying its reducer/default), the equivalent `agentStepStateSpec` Annotation fragment (legacy/Annotation path), and `agentStepInternalSlotMask` (the `.omit()` mask of those slot keys for deriving a graph input schema).
- **runner.ts** — the thin public entry points: `buildAgentStepTool` (validate + compile once, LangGraph tool binding) and `runSteps` (the direct test seam).
- **compile/** — `validate.ts` (every construction-time check, incl. cross-action config pairs and state-schema channel completeness), `plan.ts` (`BuildAgentStepToolOptions` + the compiled plan), `schema.ts` / `describe.ts` (the model-facing schema + description), `state-schema.ts` (`StateSchemaLike` resolution).
- **run/** — `admission.ts` (fixed-order whole-batch preconditions), `planning.ts` (confirm-mode freeze = the same-batch-bypass safety property), `execution.ts` (per-step loop, effects ordering, handoff monotonicity), `finalize.ts` (result body + error-counter/auto-handoff policy), `batch-state.ts` (the single write path into view/committed), `value-equal.ts` (canonical value equality).
- **interaction/** — one policy module per interaction kind: `confirmation.ts`, `otp.ts`, `match.ts`, `flow.ts`, `bounded-choice.ts` (each states its lockdown, attempts, freshness, and clearing rules in one place; `bounded-choice.ts` also owns caller-turn identity resolution), plus `guard-latch.ts` — the turn-scoped latch (`guardFiredOnTurn` / `markGuardFired`) letting a HOST model-input guard fire at most once per caller turn, built on that same identity.
- **controls/** — the library-owned model-facing actions (`abort.ts`, `request-handoff.ts`, `bounded-choice.ts`, `deflect-aside.ts`) as `ControlAction` implementations in an ordered `registry.ts`.
- **handoff/** — library-coordinated channel handoff for specialized agents: `contract.ts` (`HandoffSpec`, `HANDOFF_ACTION`, `HANDBACK_SIGNALS`, `handoffRequested`, `forcedHandoffRequested`), `node.ts` (`createHandoffNode` — terminate envelope or delegate to another LangGraph deployment with live token pass-through; also resolves a state-derived FORCED handoff), `delegate-client.ts` (SSE/Platform-API transport). Opt-in; see `streaming-and-channel-contract.md`.
- **messages.ts** — the runner's overridable system `summary` strings (neutral English defaults).
- **define-config.ts** — identity helper for typed `defineConfig({...})` calls.
- **index.ts** — the public surface (re-exports; only what's here is API). Includes `StateSchemaLike` (the `stateSchema` option's type: an Annotation OR a Zod object), the bounded-choice types, and `agentStepInternalSlotMask`.
- **capture.ts** — caller-digit capture primitives for tool param authoring (`digitsOnly`, `callerDigits`, `digitGroupsParam`, `digitCandidatesParam`); see `agent-step-api.md` `<caller_digit_capture>`.
- **runner.test.ts**, **handoff.test.ts**, **bounded-choice.test.ts**, **hardening.test.ts**, **paginate.test.ts**, **capture.test.ts**, **guard-latch.test.ts**, **zod-state.test.ts** — unit tests covering every runner branch, the handoff machinery, the bounded-choice policy, the hardening guards, the pagination primitives, the digit-capture primitives, the turn-scoped guard latch, and the Zod-schema merger derivation. Run via `npm test`.

**Never modify the library in a generated project.** The source of truth for the runner library is this skill's own `templates/agent-step/` directory. If you find a real bug in the runner, fix it there (and update `templates/agent-step/runner.test.ts` to cover it), then regenerate — never hand-patch a copy inside a generated project, or it will drift from the templates and the next bootstrap will reintroduce the bug.

## Graph scaffold

**llm-env.ts** — Reads `AZURE_OPENAI_*` env at module load via `dotenv.config({ override: true })`; throws if any required var is missing. Exports `llmEnv` constants including `temperature` parsed from `TEMPERATURE` (default 0).

**cli-env-init.ts** — Side-effect-only module imported FIRST by `cli.ts`. Sets `CARDS_BACKEND_TRACE=0` (or equivalent per tool) by default so the CLI's structured per-step output isn't drowned by raw backend chatter. Override by setting `<TOOL>_BACKEND_TRACE=1` explicitly.

**state.ts** — a single Zod `AgentStateSchema` (`MessagesZodState.extend({...})`) — the one source of truth for both reducers and validation, no Annotation/Zod dual definition. Spreads the library's `agentStepZodShape` (the eight library-managed slots `awaitingInput` / `currentFlow` / `boundedChoice` / `pagedRead` / `deflectedAside` / `handoff` / `errorCount` / `guardTurn`, each `withLangGraph`-wrapped with its reducer/default) and declares the CHANNEL WIRE CONTRACT slots (snake_case `user_id` / `customer_code` / `role` / `channel` with preserve-initial reducers via `withLangGraph` — the middleware's invoke-input field names; never rename) plus the `pendingHandoff` slot + `PendingHandoff` type the scaffold handoff machinery uses (see `streaming-and-channel-contract.md`). Exports `State = ExtractStateType<typeof AgentStateSchema>` (the value types nodes receive) and `AgentInputSchema` — the state schema minus `agentStepInternalSlotMask` + `pendingHandoff`, `.partial()`, with `messages` re-attached from `MessagesZodState.shape.messages` (so LangGraph Studio keeps rendering its chat input box rather than the raw-state editor) — the graph input schema for invoke-boundary validation when a hand-built `StateGraph` is used. Per-tool slots (via `withLangGraph`) are added in this file as tools are introduced.

**agent.ts** — Builds the `createReactAgent` with `AzureChatOpenAI` LLM + `MemorySaver` checkpointer + the tools registered in `src/tools/index.ts` + the prompt builder. Includes the `postModelHook` handoff annotator: when a tool's handoff executor wrote `pendingHandoff` this turn, the final reply is stamped with the middleware's `is_handoff` `additional_kwargs` contract. A no-op until a handoff tool exists — keep it in place.

**graph.ts** — Single export `graph` — what `langgraph.json` references. Logs env presence at load (useful for diagnosing missing env in deployed containers).

**prompt.ts** — System prompt builder. Has sections (SCOPE, OFF-TOPIC POLICY, CHANNEL CONSTRAINTS, OPERATING LOOP, IDENTIFICATION, ACTIONS, MUTATION SAFETY, VOICE RULES, EXAMPLES) — most start as `{{TBD — ...}}` placeholders. The `create-tool` workflow fills them in incrementally. Several placeholders are **role-conditional** (orchestrator / specialized / standalone — resolved from the bootstrap agent-role input): the SCOPE closer, the OFF-TOPIC POLICY keep/delete, the CHANNEL CONSTRAINTS transfer line, and the OPERATING LOOP wrap. MUTATION SAFETY teaches `abort_pending_input` as the universal abort for any pending input or flow.

**cli.ts** — In-process streaming REPL. Raw-mode terminal, multi-line input, history, ESC to abort, slash commands (`/state`, `/history`, `/new`, `/last`, `/copy`, `/quit`, `/help`). Per-step tool envelope display: each batch step printed as a dim bullet with ok/fail and surfaced fields. Imports `cli-env-init.ts` first to silence backend logs.

**tools/index.ts** — Empty barrel. The first `create-tool` invocation adds an import + array entry. Subsequent tools append.

## Local sandbox: sandbox/

A required, self-contained service at the project root that mimics the **backend APIs** the tools call (never AI resources — LLM endpoints and search indexes stay real). Lifecycle CRUD at `POST/GET /sandbox` + `GET/PUT/DELETE /sandbox/:sandboxId`, domain-endpoint isolation via the case-insensitive `Sandbox-Id` header, and mandatory JSON seeding via `PUT /sandbox/:id` — the cycle the per-tool sandbox tests reset with. Acquired best-effort at bootstrap (reference project → adapt → Postman collection → specs) or, if nothing exists to build from yet, deferred explicitly to the first `/create-tool`. Full contract + compliance checklist: `sandbox-contract.md`.

## Shared test harness: src/test-harness/

Generic, tool-agnostic scaffolding the per-tool test suites build on. Shipped at bootstrap so the testing methodology (see the `test-agent-step` skill) has real, in-project infrastructure to grade against — not files that only exist in some reference project.

- **sandbox.ts** — The sandbox/tool layer (no LLM). Re-exports `runSteps` and `assert`; provides `foldCommitted` (thread one batch's `committed` into the next batch's starting state, mirroring the graph between turns), `requireReachable` (assert the local sandbox answers before a suite runs), and `resetViaHttp` (POST a seed to a reset endpoint). Tool tests import these via their own `tests/tool/_setup.ts`.
- **prompt-input.ts** — The prompt-input layer (live model, no execution). Lazy-imports the model + tools + `llm-env` (so the file imports without credentials and the suite self-skips), binds the project's real tools to the model, runs the real `buildPrompt`, and returns the **steps the model emitted** before any execution. Provides `runUserTurn` / `runTurn` / `priorToolTurn` drivers, `expect*` assertions over emitted steps, and `promptInputEnabled()` / `promptInputSkipReason` for gating behind `PROMPT_INPUT_LIVE`.
- **index.ts** — Barrel over both layers. (Tests usually import the specific layer directly; keeping the two layers in separate modules ensures a sandbox test never pulls in the live-model machinery.)

**The harness compiles against zero tools.** At bootstrap the tools array is empty and there are no `tests/` directories yet; the harness still typechecks because the prompt-input layer defers all model/tool imports to call time.
</per_file_purpose>

<what_bootstrap_does_NOT_do>
The bootstrap workflow intentionally does NOT:

- **Write `.env`** — only `.env.example`. The user fills in real secrets manually.
- **Add tools** — `src/tools/` is empty after bootstrap. The user runs `/create-tool` to add the first one.
- **Run `npm run dev`** — only verifies it can boot. The user runs it for real interactive testing.
- **Initialize git** — proposed as an optional final step, not auto-done.
- **Configure LangSmith** — `.env.example` lists the variables; the user fills them in if they want tracing.

These are deliberate boundaries: bootstrap produces a runnable shape, the user owns the credentials and the domain content.
</what_bootstrap_does_NOT_do>

<post_bootstrap_workflow>
After bootstrap, the user's next steps are:

1. `cp .env.example .env`, fill in Azure OpenAI + (eventually) backend creds.
2. `/create-tool` — add the first tool. This scaffolds the tool's `tests/` (sandbox + prompt-input) against the shared harness.
3. `npm run dev` to test via the dev server, OR `npm run cli` to test via the REPL. `npm run test:sandbox` once the local sandbox is up; `npm run test:prompt` for routing checks (live model).
4. Iterate: more `/create-tool` invocations for additional tools, then `./build_and_push.sh latest` when ready to deploy.

Bootstrap ships the shared **harness** but no per-tool **tests** (there are no tools yet) — those arrive with each `/create-tool`. The `test:sandbox` / `test:prompt` scripts are clean no-ops until then.
