description: Investigates a LangGraph thread conversation by querying the LangGraph dev server API and (when configured) the LangSmith cloud API. Extracts runs, checkpoints, state progressions, LLM prompts/responses, and produces root cause analysis. Use when debugging a LangGraph conversation thread or analyzing agent behavior for a specific thread_id.
---

<objective>
Deep-dive investigation of a LangGraph.js conversation thread. Exhaustively queries the available log sources — the LangGraph dev server (local HTTP API) and LangSmith (cloud traces, when enabled) — to reconstruct the full state progression, identify where things went wrong, and produce actionable root-cause analysis.

Takes a `thread_id` as input. Optionally accepts a port (default `2024`) and a LangSmith project name (default: whatever `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` is set to in the project's environment).
</objective>

<assumptions>
Graph-agnostic. This skill knows the LangGraph dev-server and LangSmith **API shapes**, not your graph. The state fields, node names, and decision signals it surfaces are **discovered from the thread**, not assumed. Where this doc shows field names (e.g. a routing decision, a confidence score), treat them as *illustrative examples* of the kind of signal to look for — substitute your graph's actual state fields, which you learn from the thread `values` and the graph's `state` definition (`src/**/state.ts` or equivalent).
</assumptions>

<quick_start>
Given a thread_id, run through these phases in order:

0. **Discover the environment** — find the running instance that OWNS the thread (not just the configured port), map it to its project, and inventory the available monitoring sources (dev-server API, LangSmith key/endpoint/tracing, logs, other tracing backends).
1. **LangGraph dev server** — thread state, runs list, full checkpoint history.
2. **LangSmith** — trace tree, LLM prompts and responses (only if Phase 0 found it available — key + endpoint + traces in the thread's time window).
3. **Analysis** — state-progression table, root-cause identification.

All queries use `curl` piped to `python3` for JSON parsing. This doc writes `2024` as a placeholder — use the owning instance's port from Phase 0.
</quick_start>

<process>

<phase name="0_discover_environment">
**Phase 0: Discover the environment (instance, monitoring sources, credentials)**

Three detections, in order. Print the resulting **monitoring inventory** before investigating, so the user sees which sources the analysis can and cannot use.

**0a. Locate the instance that OWNS the thread.** A `thread_id` lives in ONE server's storage (the dev server persists per project — a local `.langgraph_api/` directory unless external `DATABASE_URI` persistence is configured). A 404 on some port does NOT mean the thread doesn't exist — it usually means you asked the wrong instance.

1. Collect candidate ports: the project-configured one (`langgraph.json` env file, `package.json` dev-script `--port`, `docker-compose.y*ml` port mapping, README — strongest signal first; CLI default `2024`) PLUS every live listener that answers like a LangGraph server:
```bash
for p in $(lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN 2>/dev/null | grep -oE ':[0-9]+ \(LISTEN\)' | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sort -un); do
  body=$(curl -s -m 1 "http://localhost:$p/info" 2>/dev/null)
  case "$body" in *'"flags"'*) echo "LangGraph instance on port $p";; esac
done
```
2. Ask each live instance for the thread — the owner returns `200`:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:{PORT}/threads/{thread_id}
```
3. Map the owning instance to its project (so Phase 0b reads the RIGHT `.env` and state definitions): for a host process, `ps -p <pid> -o command=` + `lsof -p <pid> | grep cwd` give the CLI command and working directory; for a container, `docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Ports}}'` + `docker inspect <name>` (mounts/env) identify the project. Cross-check via `POST /assistants/search` — the instance's `graph_id`s must match the project's `langgraph.json` `graphs` map.
4. If NO live instance owns the thread: the server that recorded it isn't running. Identify the likely project (a `.langgraph_api/` directory marks where a dev server has run), report that the thread's storage is offline, and ask before starting anything.

**0b. Inventory the monitoring methods.** Build the menu of available sources for THIS investigation:

- **Dev-server API** — available iff 0a found the owning instance (state / runs / checkpoint history → Phase 1).
- **LangSmith** — detect from the owning project's env, three facts, each from the project's env file (the one `langgraph.json`'s `env` key names), then the running instance's environment (`docker exec <container> printenv …`, or `ps eww <pid>` for a host process), then the shell env:
```bash
grep -E '^(LANGSMITH_API_KEY|LANGCHAIN_API_KEY|LANGSMITH_PROJECT|LANGSMITH_TRACING|LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2|LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT|LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT)=' .env
```
  - **Key**: `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` (legacy `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`). No key anywhere → LangSmith unavailable.
  - **Endpoint**: `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` (legacy `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT`) — default `https://api.smith.langchain.com`, but EU (`https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com`) and self-hosted deployments differ. Carry the resolved base URL through every Phase 2 query.
  - **Recording**: `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` (legacy `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true`) — and note it must have been on **when the thread ran**: confirm in Phase 2 by checking traces actually exist in the thread's time window (`updated_at` from 1a) rather than trusting the current flag.
- **Process/container logs** — `docker logs <container>` for containerized servers; the dev terminal's stdout for host processes (note availability, don't dump).
- **Other tracing backends** — sweep the same env sources for `LANGFUSE_*` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_*` vars; if present, note them as additional sources the user may want consulted (this skill queries LangSmith only).

Report the inventory as one short list (source → available/unavailable + why), then proceed with the available ones.
</phase>

<phase name="1_langgraph_dev_server">
**Phase 1: LangGraph dev server queries**

Run these three queries to get the full picture from the local server.

**1a. Thread current state**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:2024/threads/{thread_id} | python3 -m json.tool
```

Extract: `status`, `updated_at`, and the `values` keys. From `values`, note the message list plus whatever **domain signals** your graph writes — routing/classification decisions, detected tools, confidence scores, extracted arguments, input-context fields, accumulated lists, etc. (Read the `values` to learn which fields exist; they are graph-specific.)

Two cross-graph signals worth checking explicitly:
- **Handoff kwargs on AI messages** — `additional_kwargs.is_handoff` (+ `handoff_type`, `handoff_reason`, `handoff_metadata`) marks a channel-handoff turn; `delegated_to` WITHOUT `is_handoff` marks a delegated-and-kept turn. Handoff state slots (e.g. `pendingHandoff`, `handoff`) corroborate.
- **Step-batch tool envelopes** — when tool messages carry `{ summary, results: [...] }` with per-step entries (`{ action, ok, verdict/error, ... }`), tabulate them: action name, ok, verdict per step is the densest decision trail in the thread (which steps the model batched, which were refused — prereq denials, sole-step refusals, pending-input locks — and which executors failed).

**1b. All runs for the thread**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:2024/threads/{thread_id}/runs | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'Total runs: {len(data)}')
for r in data:
    print(f'  run={r[\"run_id\"][:8]} status={r[\"status\"]} created={r[\"created_at\"]} updated={r[\"updated_at\"]}')
"
```

**1c. Full checkpoint history (state progression)**

This is the most valuable query. It shows every intermediate state the graph passed through — one checkpoint per node transition, with `metadata.step` counting up from `-1` (input) through the node sequence.

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:2024/threads/{thread_id}/history' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"limit": 50}' | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'Total checkpoints: {len(data)}')
# Large fields drown the output if printed per-checkpoint. Keep them in state,
# just don't echo them here — request them individually when diagnosing.
# Add YOUR graph's big derived fields (formatted blobs, retrieved docs, etc.).
SKIP = {'messages'}
for i, cp in enumerate(data):
    meta = cp.get('metadata', {}) or {}
    step = meta.get('step', '?')
    source = meta.get('source', '?')
    run_id = str(meta.get('run_id', ''))[-8:]
    next_nodes = cp.get('next', [])
    vals = cp.get('values', {}) or {}
    msgs = vals.get('messages', []) or []
    last_msg_type = msgs[-1].get('type', '?') if msgs else 'none'
    last_msg_content = msgs[-1].get('content', '') if msgs else ''
    if isinstance(last_msg_content, list):
        last_msg_content = last_msg_content[0].get('text', '') if last_msg_content else ''
    last_msg_content = (last_msg_content or '')[:120]

    print(f'\n--- Checkpoint {i} (step={step}, source={source}, run=...{run_id}) ---')
    print(f'  next: {next_nodes}')
    print(f'  messages: {len(msgs)}, last: [{last_msg_type}] {last_msg_content}')
    for k in sorted(vals.keys()):
        if k in SKIP:
            continue
        v = vals[k]
        s = json.dumps(v, ensure_ascii=False) if not isinstance(v, str) else v
        print(f'  {k}: {s[:160]}')
"
```

To inspect a large field (retrieved docs, full conversation, a big formatted blob), pull it from `vals` on the specific checkpoint of interest — don't widen `SKIP`'s exclusions globally or the dump becomes unreadable.

**Node-built final messages & stream-only events**

Some graphs end a turn with a message a NODE constructed (e.g. a handoff resolver, a post-model hook rewriting the reply) rather than an LLM generation. Two consequences for the investigation:
- In LangSmith there is **no LLM run** for that message — don't hunt for a "missing" LLM call; read the node's run (`run_type=chain`) instead. The checkpoint history shows which node appended it.
- **Custom control-plane events** (e.g. `handoff`, `delegated_token`, `handoff_complete`) are stream-only — they exist neither in checkpoints nor in `/threads/{id}` values. To observe them, re-run the turn with the `run-langgraph-conversation` skill's streaming-capture mode (`stream_mode: ["messages-tuple","updates","custom"]`).

**`/history` deserialization caveat**

`/history` can return HTTP 500 (e.g. `Invalid identifer: $`) when a thread's messages include a **custom message subclass** the checkpoint deserializer doesn't recognise. When you hit this:
- Note it as an app-side checkpoint-serde issue, not a skill bug — re-running won't help.
- Fall back to what still works: 1a (`GET /threads/{id}`) and 1b (`GET /threads/{id}/runs`). The final `values` from 1a still contains the end-state signals; lean on LangSmith (Phase 2) for per-step LLM detail.
</phase>

<phase name="2_langsmith_cloud">
**Phase 2: LangSmith cloud queries**

LangSmith provides the detailed LLM-level traces (prompts, responses, token counts) that the dev server doesn't expose.

**Prerequisites**: LangSmith is opt-in and often **off by default**. You already located the key, endpoint, project name, and tracing flag in Phase 0b (from the owning project's `.env`, the running instance's environment, or the shell). Export both for the queries below:
```bash
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=$(grep -E '^LANGSMITH_API_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)
export LANGSMITH_BASE=${LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT:-https://api.smith.langchain.com}
```
If the tracing flag wasn't on (`LANGSMITH_TRACING` / `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`), or no key exists anywhere, **skip Phase 2 entirely** and rely on Phase 1 + the final assistant message. Even with the flag on NOW, verify traces exist for the thread's time window (compare `updated_at` from 1a against 2b's results) — tracing may have been off when the thread actually ran.

**2a. Find the project/session ID**

```bash
curl -s "$LANGSMITH_BASE/api/v1/sessions" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGSMITH_API_KEY" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
for p in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print(f'  id={p[\"id\"]} name={p[\"name\"]}')
"
```

**2b. List trace runs (note: `session` is an array)**

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$LANGSMITH_BASE/api/v1/runs/query" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGSMITH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session": ["{PROJECT_ID}"],
    "limit": 30
  }' | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
runs = data.get('runs', [])
print(f'Found {len(runs)} runs')
for r in runs:
    parent = r.get('parent_run_id')
    trace = r.get('trace_id', '')
    print(f'  id={r[\"id\"][:16]} name={r.get(\"name\"):24s} type={r.get(\"run_type\"):6s} parent={str(parent)[:16] if parent else \"ROOT\":16s} trace={str(trace)[:16]}')
"
```

Match traces to thread runs by comparing timestamps and run IDs. LangGraph run IDs typically appear as LangSmith trace IDs for the root run named after the registered `graph_id`. The child run names map to your graph's nodes — the LLM-call nodes (`run_type=llm`) are the ones to read in full when classification, generation, or grounding misbehaves.

**2c. Get a detailed LLM run (prompt + response)**

For each LLM run (look for `run_type=llm`, typically named after the chat model, e.g. `AzureChatOpenAI` / `ChatOpenAI`):

```bash
curl -s "$LANGSMITH_BASE/api/v1/runs/{RUN_ID}" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGSMITH_API_KEY" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
r = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'name: {r.get(\"name\")}  status: {r.get(\"status\")}')

inputs = r.get('inputs', {})
msgs = inputs.get('messages', [])
for mg in msgs:
    items = mg if isinstance(mg, list) else [mg]
    for m in items:
        kwargs = m.get('kwargs', {})
        content = kwargs.get('content', '')
        if isinstance(content, str) and len(content) > 100:
            print(f'\n--- PROMPT ({len(content)} chars) ---')
            print(content[:5000])
            if len(content) > 5000:
                print(f'... [{len(content) - 5000} more chars]')

outputs = r.get('outputs', {})
gens = outputs.get('generations', [[]])
if gens and gens[0]:
    text = gens[0][0].get('text', '')
    gen_info = gens[0][0].get('generation_info', {})
    print(f'\n--- LLM RESPONSE ---')
    print(text[:3000])
    print(f'\n--- TOKEN USAGE ---')
    usage = gen_info.get('token_usage', {})
    print(f'  prompt={usage.get(\"prompt_tokens\")} completion={usage.get(\"completion_tokens\")} total={usage.get(\"total_tokens\")}')
    print(f'  model={gen_info.get(\"model_name\")}')
"
```

For long prompts, slice further: `print(content[5000:12000])`. Read the system prompt in full when routing/classification or grounding misbehaves — the prompt is half the explanation for any LLM decision.

**2d. Get graph-node inputs/outputs**

```bash
curl -s "$LANGSMITH_BASE/api/v1/runs/{NODE_RUN_ID}" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LANGSMITH_API_KEY" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
r = json.load(sys.stdin)
print('--- INPUTS ---')
print(json.dumps(r.get('inputs', {}), ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)[:5000])
print('\n--- OUTPUTS ---')
print(json.dumps(r.get('outputs', {}), ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)[:3000])
"
```
</phase>

<phase name="3_analysis">
**Phase 3: Produce analysis**

After collecting all data, produce a structured report.

**3a. Thread summary table**

| Run | Input (user message) | Decision / branch | Result | Status |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 (`...xxxx`) | "user said this" | which branch the graph took | "agent responded this" | success/fail |

**3b. State progression (for failing or surprising runs)**

Show how state variables changed at each checkpoint within the failing run. Build the node sequence from the checkpoints' `next`/`step` rather than assuming one — then, per step, list the key state changes:

| Step | Node | Key state changes |
|------|------|-------------------|
| -1 (input) | `__start__` | initial state from input |
| 0 | `<first node>` | which fields it set |
| … | … | … |

The single most common bug location in a routed/branched graph is the **first decision node picking the wrong branch** — the rest of the graph then executes the wrong path correctly. Always compare the user's intent with what the graph decided before suspecting downstream nodes.

**3c. LLM analysis (for failing runs)**

- What the LLM was prompted with (the key sections of the system prompt for the failing node).
- What the LLM returned (extracted classification, reasoning, or text).
- Whether that was correct against the user's intent, and what it should have been.

**3d. Code-path analysis**

- Which node processed the LLM output and how (parsed JSON, emitted text, etc.).
- How the state reducer interpreted the values (straight-set vs append vs custom merge).
- Where the logic failed — e.g. a branch didn't fire because a confidence/threshold check or a config value blocked it.

**3e. Root cause**

Identify the root cause(s), distinguishing between:
- **LLM decision errors** — a node misunderstood the input.
- **Prompt engineering issues** — the prompt didn't guide the LLM well enough. Note where the prompt actually lives: if it's loaded at runtime from an external source (blob store, DB, files) rather than read from source at request time, fixing it means editing that source and redeploying/re-seeding — not just editing a file in the repo.
- **Config issues** — a threshold, feature flag, or registry entry blocked the expected path.
- **Tool / retrieval gaps** — an external call returned nothing relevant (inspect that node's output payload and the query it actually sent).
- **Code logic errors** — a node mishandled the LLM output (rare; usually visible in the node's outputs payload).
- **State-management issues** — a reducer didn't apply as expected (e.g. a preserve-initial reducer keeping a stale value across turns, or an append reducer duplicating).
- **Handoff/routing decision errors** — the agent handed off when it should have answered (or vice versa), picked the wrong target/signal, or a handoff was refused by a guardrail (`service_disabled`, business-hours gates, sole-step batch refusals) and the prompt's recovery didn't fire. Check the handoff kwargs/slots from 1a and the step-batch envelope verdicts. Remember the dev server has no fronting middleware: locally, post-handback turns hitting the same agent is expected, not a bug.
</phase>

<api_reference>
**LangGraph dev server endpoints:**
- `GET /threads/{thread_id}` — current thread state.
- `GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs` — list of runs.
- `POST /threads/{thread_id}/history` — checkpoint history (body: `{"limit": N}`).
- `GET /info` — server health (returns `{"flags":{...}}`).

**LangSmith API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/sessions` — list projects.
- `POST /api/v1/runs/query` — query runs (body: `{"session": ["ID"], "limit": N}`).
- `GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}` — detailed run with inputs/outputs.

**LangSmith query gotchas:**
- `session` must be an **array** of project IDs, not a single string.
- The thread ID may not be in run metadata — match by timestamps and trace IDs instead.
- LLM inputs are nested: `inputs.messages[].kwargs.content` (LangChain serialization).
- LLM outputs are in: `outputs.generations[0][0].text`.

Investigation is complete when:

- All runs for the thread have been identified and summarized with the branch/decision each took.
- Full checkpoint history has been extracted showing state at every step (or the `/history` 500 has been called out and the fallback path used).
- LLM prompts and responses have been retrieved for the relevant LLM runs (when LangSmith is enabled).
- A state-progression table shows exactly where state diverged from expected.
- A root cause has been identified with a clear distinction between LLM error vs prompt issue vs config issue vs tool/retrieval gap vs code error vs state/reducer issue.
- The user has enough information to decide on a fix.
