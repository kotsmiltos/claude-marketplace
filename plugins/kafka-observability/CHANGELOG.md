# observability library — CHANGELOG

The version here is the **vendored library** version (`templates/observability/VERSION`),
independent of the plugin version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Downstream projects
carry a copy of this library in `src/observability/`; `/add-kafka-observability` compares
their `src/observability/VERSION` against the shipped one and upgrades via the
version-keyed guides in `migrations/`.

## 1.2.0 (2026-08-05)

Attachment-robustness release, closing the INC-2026-0045 root cause: in QA App Service
(LangGraph Platform image) the tracer **never attached** — `registerConfigureHook` stores
its registry in AsyncLocalStorage (`enterWith` at registration, `getStore()` at configure
time), so a hook registered at graph-module load is invisible to any run whose async
context does not descend from `startup()`. Platform harnesses that create their
run-dispatch channel before importing the graph sever exactly that ancestry; the hook
registers cleanly at boot, then silently never fires (`_getConfigureHooks()` returns `[]`).
The identical image worked in local docker-compose because there the graph import
preceded the server — reproduced mechanically on Node 22 (a server created before the
import never sees the `enterWith` store, even for later connections).

Additive: no event-schema, transport, or wiring change; existing deployments upgrade by
file refresh (see `migrations/1.1.0-to-1.2.0.md`).

- **`configure-slot.ts`** (new) — `installConfigureSlot()` wraps this package's own
  `CallbackManager._configureSync` (the exact attachment point LangSmith's tracer
  occupies — the only ancestry-independent slot) and appends a `KafkaRunTracer` with the
  hook path's exact semantics: `KAFKA_ENABLED === "true"` gate checked at configure time,
  fresh instance per configure, deduped by handler name, inheritable. Idempotent
  (Symbol.for marker), reversible, runtime-only (nothing on disk is patched), confined to
  the library's own `@langchain/core` copy. Falls back to wrapping `configure()` with a
  warning if the underscored static ever disappears.
- **ALS-break detector** — when the hook was registered too (`both` mode) and the slot
  still had to attach, one loud `[observability] ALS context break detected: … (store
  classification)` line fires, distinguishing severed ancestry (`store-undefined`) from a
  clobbered store and from a foreign-core-copy registration — the discriminating evidence
  for the upstream escalation.
- **Boot attachment diagnostics** — startup now logs one greppable line: attach mode,
  pid, resolved `@langchain/core/context` URL (which physical copy), shared-ALS presence,
  hooks visible at boot (registration readback), `NODE_OPTIONS` + `execArgv` (injected
  agent/loader detection); plus a duplicate-library warning when a second `startup()`
  sees a different core URL.
- **`KAFKA_ATTACH_MODE`** (`settings.ts`, new optional env var) — `hook` | `patch` |
  `both` (default `both`: hook + slot, deduped; the slot doubles as the hook's failure
  detector). Invalid values throw at startup (no-config-fallback rule).
- **`index.ts`** — `startup()` wires the chosen attachment path(s) and the diagnostics;
  exports `getAttachDiagnostics()`; `__resetForTests()` also restores the configure slot
  (the hook remains un-unregisterable — unchanged upstream limitation).
- **`configure-slot.test.ts`** (new) — documents the upstream failure (a registered hook
  firing in a descendant context but NOT under `als.run(undefined, …)`), and proves the
  slot attaches under that break, dedupes by name, installs idempotently, stays inert
  unless `KAFKA_ENABLED` is exactly `"true"`, and uninstalls cleanly.

## 1.1.0 (2026-08-04)

Connection-diagnostics release, motivated by a real QA incident: an agent's events never
reached the shared sink, and the logs made the failure undiagnosable — startup printed
"Kafka run tracing ready" **before** any broker/SASL handshake, and a producer that never
connects is otherwise silent (the drain loop no-ops until librdkafka's "ready" event,
`event.error` does not reliably fire against black-holed egress, and the queue-full
warning needs `KAFKA_QUEUE_MAXSIZE` events to trigger). "Connected" and "never connected"
were indistinguishable from application logs.

No behavior changes beyond logging: `produce()`, drain, shutdown semantics, config keys,
and the disabled-by-default contract are untouched. Pure file refresh for consumers —
re-run `/add-kafka-observability` (see `migrations/1.0.0-to-1.1.0.md`).

- **`kafka-producer.ts`** — logs `[observability] Kafka producer connected` when the
  broker handshake actually completes, and arms a one-shot, `unref()`'d connection
  watchdog (default 30 s — 10× the 3 s socket setup timeout, generous for SASL_SSL) that
  warns when the producer has still not connected, including the current in-memory queue
  fill (`queue N/max`). Cleared on "ready" and on `shutdown()`. The threshold is an
  injectable constructor parameter so tests don't wait 30 s.
- **`index.ts`** — the startup line no longer claims readiness:
  "Kafka run tracing ready: …" → "Kafka run tracing initialized (producer connecting in
  background): …" (same app/topic/brokers/retries fields).
- **`kafka-producer.test.ts`** — two new watchdog tests on the existing
  unreachable-broker harness: the not-connected warning fires with the queue fill, and
  `shutdown()` clears the watchdog (no stray warning after a deliberate close).

## 1.0.0 (2026-08-03)

Initial release.

- **`KafkaRunTracer`** (`run-tracer.ts`) — a `BaseTracer` subclass attached globally via
  `registerConfigureHook` (the same mechanism LangSmith's own tracer uses). Captures every
  traced run — graph invocation, each LangGraph node, each LLM call (full rendered
  messages, invocation params, outputs, token usage), each tool run — and emits **two
  events per run**: `direction: "request"` at run creation (inputs) and
  `direction: "response"` at run end (inputs + outputs/error, latency, status). Trace
  hierarchy travels in every event (`trace_id`, `parent_run_id`, `dotted_order`) so the
  full LangSmith-style run tree is reconstructable downstream. `thread_id` is resolved
  from run metadata (LangGraph injects `configurable.thread_id` there), with a
  per-trace fallback map for child runs that carry no metadata.
- **Event envelope** (`schemas.ts`, zod-validated) — the bank-standard
  `{ id, thread_id, application_name, timestamp, data }` shape already consumed by the
  shared Elasticsearch sink. Kafka message key is the event's own `id` (per the
  ivr-router design-027 rev.2 finding: the sink upserts by key, so keying by thread
  collapses a thread's events into one document).
- **Transport** (`kafka-producer.ts`, `bounded-queue.ts`) — `@confluentinc/kafka-javascript`
  (librdkafka) behind a bounded in-memory queue (default 1000) with a 10 ms background
  drain loop. `produce()` never blocks; a full queue drops the event and logs a running
  count. `acks=all`, idempotent producer, bounded `shutdown()` (drain → flush → disconnect,
  every phase raced against a timer — librdkafka's own timeouts do not reliably bound a
  never-connected broker). Ported verbatim from ivr-router-ts design-027 (live-verified).
- **Redaction** (`redaction.ts`) — recursive masking of `authorization` / `api_key` /
  `password` / `token` / `secret` / `credential` / `connection_string` keys and
  `password=` fragments in string values, applied to every payload before serialization.
- **Size cap** — events over 512 KB are replaced by a truncation marker
  (`{ type: "truncated", original_bytes, sha256 }`).
- **Config** (`settings.ts`, `env.ts`) — `KAFKA_ENABLED` gate (must be exactly `"true"` —
  the global callback hook compares strictly); when enabled, `APPLICATION_NAME`,
  `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`, `KAFKA_OBSERVABILITY_TOPIC` are required and fail fast
  (no-config-fallback rule). Optional: `KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`, `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`,
  `KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME`, `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD`, `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID`,
  `KAFKA_PRODUCER_LINGER_MS`, `KAFKA_PRODUCER_BATCH_SIZE`, `KAFKA_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`,
  `KAFKA_PRODUCER_RETRIES`, `KAFKA_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- Disabled by default: `startup()` is a no-op without `KAFKA_ENABLED=true`; no Kafka env
  var is read or required, and the tracer is never attached.
