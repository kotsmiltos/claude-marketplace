description: Install or upgrade LangSmith-parity Kafka observability in a LangGraph.js / LangChain.js agent repo. Vendors the src/observability/ library (a BaseTracer subclass publishing EVERY traced run — graph, nodes, LLM calls with full prompts/outputs/usage, tool runs — as start/end events to a Kafka topic), adds the @confluentinc/kafka-javascript dependency, wires ONE startup() call at the graph entrypoint via a global callback hook, updates .env.example and deployment settings (Key Vault refs for secrets), adds a test script, and verifies with typecheck + unit tests. Use when a repo must stream its LangSmith telemetry to Kafka, replace/unplug LangSmith, add Kafka observability, or upgrade an already-vendored src/observability/ library.

<objective>
Give any LangGraph.js/LangChain.js agent repo a Kafka observability layer with **LangSmith
parity**: everything the application sends to LangSmith (every run create + run end, with
inputs, outputs, errors, latency, trace hierarchy, thread correlation) lands on a Kafka
topic as structured events. LangSmith is untouched — both sinks run in parallel until the
team flips `LANGSMITH_TRACING` off. The library is vendored (a copy in `src/observability/`,
like the agent-step runner), versioned via `VERSION`, and this skill handles BOTH first
install and upgrade.
</objective>

<essential_principles>
**1. The library is vendored and never hand-edited.** Library files are replaced wholesale
from the plugin's `templates/observability/`; project-specific behavior lives at the
project level (wiring, env values, deployment settings). Fixing a project problem by
patching the vendored library is always wrong.

**2. One wiring point.** The tracer attaches through `registerConfigureHook` — the same
global mechanism LangSmith's own tracer uses. The ONLY project edit that touches code is a
single `startup()` call at the graph entry module. Never instrument nodes, tools, or the
shared agent-step library, and never wrap the compiled graph (`withConfig`) — the export
shape consumed by `langgraph.json` must stay a `CompiledStateGraph`.

**3. Fire-and-forget is non-negotiable.** Observability must never block, slow, or crash a
conversation: bounded queue, drop-on-full, errors logged not thrown. If a change would
trade this for durability, it needs team sign-off first, not a local patch.

**4. Disabled by default, fail-fast when enabled.** `KAFKA_ENABLED` ships `false`/absent in
`.env.example` and deployment settings unless the user explicitly asks to enable. When it
IS `"true"` (strict lowercase — the hook compares exactly), missing required settings must
throw at boot (no-config-fallback rule).

**5. Secrets take Key Vault references.** In `configuration/**/settings.*.json`, SASL
credentials use `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` references, never plaintext. `.env` values are
the developer's local concern; never write real secrets into tracked files.

**6. PII is a conscious decision, not an accident.** The events carry full prompts and
transcripts (that is the point — LangSmith parity). Redaction masks secrets, not PII.
State this in the final report so the data-boundary decision is explicit and on the user.

**7. Gate before editing the project's own files.** Vendoring `src/observability/` is safe.
Everything else (graph entry wiring, package.json, .env.example, deployment settings)
is the user's code — present the full plan and get approval before writing.
</essential_principles>

<intake>
Confirm the target repo qualifies: `package.json` depends on `@langchain/core` (directly or
via `@langchain/langgraph`). If not, stop — this library hooks LangChain's callback system
and has nothing to attach to.

Detect install vs upgrade: if `src/observability/VERSION` exists, this is an **upgrade**
(compare against the plugin template's `VERSION`; if equal, report current and stop).
Otherwise it is a **first install**.

Then gather, asking only for what cannot be derived:
1. **`APPLICATION_NAME`** — propose the snake_cased `package.json` name.
2. **`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`** and **`KAFKA_OBSERVABILITY_TOPIC`** — per environment if
   the repo has `configuration/**/settings.*.json` files.
3. **Security** — none (PLAINTEXT, e.g. local/compose) or SASL (`KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`,
   `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`, username, and the Key Vault secret name for the password).
4. **Enable now or ship disabled?** Default: disabled everywhere; flipping QA/PROD to
   `true` is an ops decision.
5. Which deployment settings files to update (default: all under `configuration/`).

<routing>
Follow `workflows/add-kafka-observability.md` exactly — detect → plan → approve (gate) →
vendor → wire → configure → verify → report.

<quick_reference>
- Library source: `<plugin>/skills/add-kafka-observability/templates/observability/` (+ `VERSION`).
- Upgrade guides: `<plugin>/migrations/<from>-to-<to>.md` (apply in version order).
- Wiring (graph entry module, right after env/dotenv setup, before any invoke path):
  `import { startup as startupObservability } from "./observability/index.js";`
  `startupObservability();`
- Dependency: `@confluentinc/kafka-javascript` (native librdkafka — Docker images need a
  matching prebuild or the source-build toolchain; node-pre-gyp prebuilds cover glibc+musl).
- Test script: `"test:observability": "tsc && node --test dist/observability/*.test.js"`.
- Event contract: envelope `{ id, thread_id, application_name, timestamp, data }`, Kafka
  key = event `id` (the shared ES sink upserts by key — never key by thread_id).
- Env vars: required when enabled — `KAFKA_ENABLED`, `APPLICATION_NAME`,
  `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`, `KAFKA_OBSERVABILITY_TOPIC`; optional —
  `KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`, `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`, `KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME`,
  `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD`, `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID`, `KAFKA_PRODUCER_LINGER_MS`,
  `KAFKA_PRODUCER_BATCH_SIZE`, `KAFKA_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`, `KAFKA_PRODUCER_RETRIES`,
  `KAFKA_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`.
